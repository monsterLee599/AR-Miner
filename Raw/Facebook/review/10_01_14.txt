Hey###
This app make my phone CPU getting hot and lag.....
On Samsung Galaxy tablet, latest version stops cold for no reason and exits. Rebooting does not help. Reinstalling does not help. Hopefully you are hearing this from many others and have a fix coming soon. If not - goodbye.
FiiiXxx..
Best in the west!
Its Facebook. They mine your data, pillage your likes and dislikes for marketing, and the interface always changes for the worst. Still works smoothly but jumps me to the top of posts when I am browsing my feed. Shield portable, shield tablet, Note 3, and Nexus 5.        Please note: your contacts won't sync unless you tell it yes. You can also go into the settings to uncheck it if you need to and it will remove them.
Automatically syncing  fb contacts to my phone .  fix dis is problem .
Nice
Goood
Around the world
BULLSHIT!!!!
It keeps on closing for no reason. Its so annoying! Pls fix -_-
News feed isn't loading and having issues with posting
Because of the new update, I can't open my Facebook app.
XD:)
Love
Bolehlah
Force closes while trying to open. Same issue on multiple devices
Why is this app syncing my contacts with out my permission?  It even keeps doing after I turned it off!  If this is not took care of asap I will delete!
I really dont like this updated version because I can't find my "Liked" pages. Its kindof a bummer.
superb
Not Work Realy
This app sucks!!!!!!  Crap keeps force closing.
Thanks
Put in all on Facebook let them see what you are doing each day...
It consumes a lot of the phone's internal memory. It would be great if somehow some of the app's data can be moved to external memory (SD card)
Don' t download this apps
Love it
Keeps forcing closed, i see alot of other people are having this problem, facebook needs to get it together for we forget it forever
Please fix this . thanks
The only reason I haven't uninstalled Facebook is because I have so many pics stored. The privacy is horrible. People can still view too much by searching for me. If it were possible to be invisible to whoever I chose maybe I would give another star. If it were possible to be invisible to anyone who searches for me, I would give five stars. With all the "Creepers" and past haunts running you down constantly, it's hard to enjoy. Facebook has evolved into a nightmare that no one can wake up from, as intended.
Dumb
Loading like a snail. Long enough to finish all you can eat @ sushi resto. Sucks!
Working well
Cool
Update is syncing contacts. I have turned it off 3 times. Very invasive if it can just automatically override your decision. What's next syncing phone gallery automatically? They are invading our privacy .
Excellent work by the team!! I love it . Its faster than the previous version
Yup
Facebook way better then it use to be getting close to perfection not just few small things
It is a superb application...!
Wonderful app.....
Easy to gain info on my profile n msgs. I'm using it on my Galaxy S5
The new update is terrible, can't  use app at all, keep closing each time i open it..
i had to re-download it
lovely
Kamaljain jalna@gmailcom
I hate all the permissions i have to give to use this app and the messenger app. But now because of the new update its also syncing all of my contacts on its own. I turn it off, and it does it all over again. Needs fixed! If not im deleting both facebook and messenger
Only stays open for ten seconds then shuts down. No good. Can't use.
Will not work
What can i say it's Facebook.
I don't like it updating my contacts I don't know half my friends on there so why would I want them in my phone...i only use Facebook for games keep this up I'm going to delete this app
Loved it,
Would let me unsync my contacts!!!!!
Loved it!
Gang gang Squaaa FB Lit
New update closes app as soon as it opens : (
Unistalled app because it would automatically sync fb contacts in galaxy s4. No option to delete, can only prevent from syncing again.
So so
Love it..hoping for a "DISLIKE BOTTON" soon!
Very nice
I have good friends with the best of the day
Love it
Every time I am in the app it has auto synced. I have changed it a dozen times today. Its a pain.
What happen to this apps? Why is it won't work in my android. Can you fixed it early.
Facebook is getting ridiculous. Im considering going back to MySpace. Why does facebook automatically sync to my contacts now. Im sick of deleting them. Fix this.
Im having problems using this app.. :(
One star
good.
It is so good
I would like my news in order I don't like chaos not fun having to dig for most recent folder
I can't play clash of clans on Facebook
It's worked fine on $50 android phone.
Why is it syncing my Facebook contacts to my phone contacts?  I don't want this at all.
The app itself is just around 20MB but the data in a day reaches upto 75-90 MB. Please solve takes up a lot of space in my phone
Masst heee
Starkoko
Messenger is always appearing when i tap the message then always taping the.remind me later!
After latest update it says my Internet has unfortunately stopped working and closes FB. Please fix!
New update sucks. I don't want to see stuff from weeks ago, I want to see stuff from today. Whoever keeps making these 'improvements' should have been fired years ago, each 'improvement' has been worse. Bring back the messaging feature
Everything about Facebook
Cant click on anything  keeps on quitting
No responding freezing
Ever since the last update Facebook keeps automatically switching my settings from DO NOT link Facebook with my phone contacts to linking them. I don't want my Facebook contacts linked to my phone contacts. I don't link my phone contacts with anything and I'd like to keep it that way. I have to keep switching the settings back multiple times a day. Fix it or I will uninstall.
Why are all my Facebook friends in my contacts?? I don't want them merged with my personal contacts. Please FIX IT!!!
When are you going to add a picture comment button???
Masih boleh dinaik tarafkan keberkesanan, penulisan, gambar dan sebagainya.
Buggy and crash

I hate must give me install messenger I don't like this I wanna my chat like  before simple.n too slow for refreshing news fix soon

Horrible update.

To buggy , often not responding
Its slow as hell and kicks me out every minute or freezes then kicks me out. Sort it out its ridiculous
Good way to stay in touch with friends anywhere in the world!!
Its thee best ever
I've had it. I've been a loyal user of Facebook for years but making us use messenger and now syncing our contacts without permission even though I repeatedly select to not sync is bs...Super shadey!
Peace
Slows down my phone
Works fine, but the permissions they demand just aren't cool
... Thumbs up
If its protected
Would have give 3 star but since they require to use msg app, i give it one star.
Why feeds show old post? My feeds setting in recent update. The feeds setting not appear anymore to select recent update or popular
Works great
Great
Get rid of the built in web browser. Its slow and does not load pages.
This app is so convinient! Takes low data rate and is very utile.
Screw you and your update. Why would you make it automatically sync with contacts.
I'm tired of feeling imprisoned in my house
Nice
It keeps kicking me out. I have to go in at least 4 times until it finally lets me get a glimpse of the convo... no bueno 
Carga mejor que antes, mayor fluidez
the update is automatically syncing my facebook contacts to my phones contact list.. i dont want all my facebook friends in my contact list..
Very nice
Getting better
Great! :-)
Perfect for comonication
Never worked right, Couldn't get a live rep to assist.
Takes forever opening this app. What happened?
I hate the fact it's automatically syncing contacts to my phone worse update feature ever
Has improved immensely, timeline wise. I don't understand why the messenger app is needed though.
Automatically syncs contacts.  I have settings set to where contacts are not supposed to sync but does. Get this fixed.
This new update is automatically syncing my Facebook contacts to my phone and it's the worst. If I wanted it that then I would've done it myself. It's very annoying. This needs to be changed immediately. If this isn't fixed, I'm giving Facebook the boot for good!!!!
Still waiting for top comments on post like in the ios version.
At first this app worked fine. But over the last 2-3 weeks it closes for no reason. It started only when I touched someones name in order to see their page. Now it happens randomly as I scroll through my news feed as well as when I touch a person's name.
I like it.
STOP SYNCING MY CONTACTS
Keeps crashing
Facebook won't open half of the time and the other half of the time, an update is required. Just stupid!!!
Facebook is always crashing and freezing on me throughout the day.Fix it please
The Facebook Application takes roughly 5-10 minutes to set up. Not a great quality.
hmmmm...
This version takes forever to load content over WiFi. This would be great if my news feed had no pics in it. Instead I end up logging in from my browser to see anything.
Juniorlafleur
Loved it
Wow
Took away my "other" folder AND auto sync my contacts?! Screw you,  Facebook!! Uninstalling this POS!!
Saying setting ... and i cannot open ... and its say error what would i do  What the i cannot open it... all my app will uninstall.. to  give more storage....  Shsshzzhshs
It says ssl error and I can't sign in
nice
Locks the screen on my samsung galaxy after looking at a couple post and reboots the system. Have tried uninstalling and reloading with no help. No good will just remove.
Asiri
i couldn't edit the post which I have been posted b4 .. i post a video whc have the sentence has an error then i try it to fixed but only text box has appeared "Delete post, "edit privacy" theres no edit post... what a scrap. app. fixed it now...
keeps wanting to sync my contacts with face book when I keep denying it through both my phone settings and on Facebook setting!
L8ve it,, but pls provide it a video call,
It logs me out and makes me do this thing were I have to type in my phone number it won't let me log back in once that happens and won't let me type in my password. Plz fix it keeps making me go to Google for a thing it says log in and it  goes back to the beginning plz fix that
Excellent
Its good
Keeps closing all the time. For no reason. Was working fine until new version.  Uninstalling. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP ON YOUR TABLET.  DOESNT WORK.
Every time I hit don't sync contacts it will sync anyways! I don't want all of those contacts in my phone. This is absolutely ridiculous.
You suck!! STOP  sync with my phone contacts. DONT do it again. PLEASE I MEAN IT DONT KEEP DOING IT!!! STOP STOP!!!!!!!!
Improvements!!?? My fb won't open any links!!
Not optimized for tablets. Wall cramped with Ads
You took away the custom setting so now we can't customize who sees our status that's bull!
pajtim ramani
Social website great
It's taking up way to much space but beyond that its great.the app is 23.63mb but balloons to 100mb without me doing anything, why?!?!
During the last few months I've expirenced repeated crashes. In fact I can no longer refreshy feeds properly without having to close all apps. I have have the phone replaced twice and reinstalled fb. This makes enjoying my app almost impossible.
:)
Can't do anything on Facebook don't what happen to it.
I really enjoyed it
Love it's
Nice
I love it so much good job.. easily open stills comment everything touching nice very smart updating..
The app crashes CONSTANTLY since the last update. Just so you know.
People are going mental about Messenger having all access to their phones yet they ignore the fact that Facebook app does exactly the same thing...
Its still slow and it was a lot better when we could message people on the Facebook app.
The app is rubbish now. No more freedom of choice. Eg. Messager, contacts syncing and so on. It seems to be getting slower and slower as well with more up dates. App not the same anymore. Delete!
Crashes, closes, not responding!
Loading slow on Sensation XE
I don't know why but the app crashes almost every time I open it, I run it on a Samsung Galaxy tab 3, if it didn't crash it would be great, Facebook help!
Auto syncing fb contacts and cant turn it off
It's ok just download way too slow
Nope...getting moRe useless
It stinks. Most times i have to use my data plan instead of wi-fi
Stupid app decides to sync all my fb contacts without my authorization.
Don't know why I even update this crap app, but  I do in hope that someday it might actually work...hell i'd be happy if it just loaded.
Love fb  keeps me connected to family and friends.
Stop trying to make us get messenger and give me my privacy back.
Cool
So yeah. Why won't it STAY OFF?
Keeps syncing my Facebook friends into my phone contacts, it's annoying.
It is useful and reliable source does what i need it to do
Great!!!
Stops running and shuts down all the time.
Good
Bugs
The new UI is bizarre.  The app runs extremely slowly.  My newsfeed has changed.  Not a happy user.
Love any kind of Facebook app
It tells me that my E-mail. Is wrong but It's not that gets on my nerves
Facebook is the social networking who i really love it
Whenever I open it it starts to freeze then it just black out completely
Hope you fix what others complaining about this app.  Please fix this problems.
Memory eater
good app
Romeo
Disappointed
I give it 4 stars because its really slow at times.
This new update is even  worse. I only see a few things from a select few friends on my news feed, which was already bad. & once again you've made it worse. Could you stop, please? I DO NOT WANT TO SYNC MY CONTACTS. KNOCK IT OFF!
I wondering why during using my FB,it closed automatically again and again and again... then when i repeat to open, it seems so slow., plz fix it.. thanks
Love
Helps to stay in touch with the family and friends.
Why did it just put all my Facebook "friends" in my contacts? You already forced us to download messenger, they do not need my number. If they're close enough they'll get it with my permission. This is invading my privacy....
Good for all.
Gus nice
Very slow speed this app
Ever since updating last night, it constantly syncs my facebook contacts,  even when I turn thw setting off. It turns itself back on. Please fix it facebook!
The new app syncs with your phone's contact list even if you set your phone to not sync AND set facebook to not sync. I love scrolling through 600 names when I want to make a call (dripping with sarcasm).
The app's fine but asks for to many permissions.
Live it
When I upload a photo from my phone it makes two identical post... It's ok for me to go and delete one but sometimes I'm too late :p I wanna see all comments and likes on one post xp :)
New update syncs all contacts on your phone without even asking... really annoying
Its good. But how can I read inbox messages without messanger. I dint like messanger.
Awesome...
I love it
I love Facebook
Syncing my contacts without my permission not cool so now I have thousands of contacts smh... Won't be using the app...
I never thought that I would be on one app so much
Komary
This new update linked all my Facebook contacts to my phone. I don't want this. Tried to units tall and change my fb and phone settings. Unstalling until this get fixed.
I have a low memory phone really sad that I am supposed to download 2 large apps that I don't have room for when it used to work with just one  I'm just gonna uninstall both apps and go back to texting
Stupid
Let's me keep in touch with friends and family
Is really good and safe
Facebook is pretty good.
Like it
Fun app
Its good
Love being able to connect with family, friends and make new friends
Gps constantly on
Takes up to much phone memory unable to store on memory card
Abc123  Berkawan Biar ramai
Will not stop force closing and nothing is fixing the problem. Galaxy note 3
Love love
I cant see other pictures it keeps crashing!!! And i cant open it!!!! This is what they want us to pay for?? Wtf** useless!!!
No puedo publicar fotos ni enviar fotos por inbox....aver si lo areglan
Why is Facebook syncing my contact's I've deleted three time. If I want it to syncing them together I would do it myself .I deleted the app and will NOT redown load it until its fixed.....
its aload off f**king s**t never works n takes ages to load up.
I like it but icant'n download
FB crashes everytime i launch it
After update can't open , or wgen it dose it just freezes
Good. Way news
More Errors..
Good
Wats up with Facebook it won't open
For one it kept syncing ALL the contacts. Along with that, settings stated only contacts that I already had. And it would stay off. Everytime I turned the sync off and left the wifi zone, I'd come back to having ALL the contacts I don't want again. Good bye facebook.
Keeps syncing contacts after I tell it I don't want it to.
This is awesome no lie but ik bout that update
RAFANI
Automatically syncing facebook friends to contacts. STUPID
Keeps syncing contacts to my phone annoying took them off 5x fix this pls
The best application
All andorid Apps are good, but it's  need fck...ing update every weeks.....!?!  That's why people has to consume huge extra data net (uses) per weeks..........!
Never loads. Says I have new  notifications and messages but I don't. Won't let me send messages. Its not just the app, the website itself doesnt work anymore.
Don't no yet got to get in
Htet
Would be better if it allowed us to reply to comments. Its kind of annoying to get notifications from someone that replied to one of your comments but when you try to reply yours comes up as a separate comment.
Tired of waiting for you to fix this app.  It keeps closing for no reason.  I have uninstalled it and will now use the internet
I DO NOT WANT FACEBOOK CONTACTS IN MY PHONE & I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT YOUR TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE USE MESSENGER
Line
Y
Very Good
Great app love it ;)
The last update doesn't even open the app, it makes the phone hangs and reboot..
I think facebook is always perfect except the separation of message tools, too lazy to delete the messenger application, waste my memory. Huhu
With This Recent Update, The App Has Automatically Added All My Facebook Friends Into My Contacts On My Phone. Which I Hate, Only Way To Fix It Is To Delete The App. Please Fix This Problem Or The App Will Get Deleted!
Sort it out facebook
I hate this app! It always freezes, I can't view my notifications, and when I want to view my news feed by most recent it mixes posts with the week before. It repeats the same posts over and over.
Why is this new update syncing with my phone book. Ive deleted it three times now. Please fix this issue. If I could give it no stars I would. Total pile if crap!!
Would rather have MySpace back this app sucks donkey...
Having trouble downloading update. Please fix.
Keeps syncing my friend on facebook to my contacts. Tooken it off 4 times already. Deleting app.
Still force close oftenly. Do you guys even try? Btw, your camera roll is not user friendly at all. I can't search picture by folders. Hate it.
Yop
Causing phone to reboot.
It works great on my phone but when i use my galaxy tab 3 it keeps closing
I have a Samsung Galaxy 3 10.1 tablet.   Since the last upgrade,  FB crashes continually.   I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling,  clearing the FB and partition cache,  and as a last resort a factory reset.   Nothing has fixed the issue,  so the problem is with the 4.4.2 upgrade.   Please fix! !
The  site was a gd site til y'all switched it to Facebook messenger smfh I keep hearing and seeing bad things about it smfh ..  Y'all should switch it back exactly how it was we shouldn't have to be forced to give away personal information 
Latha
Always working in the background and taking up mem.
Never had a problem with fbook until today? What gives
Loved it its nice the best
Great app
Syncing my contacts. I switch it to off and it turns itself back on.
Great
This Facebook update app 'SUCKS' . If I'm already sign up why do it again. Don't make sense
after all the updates?facebook is not working on my phone.gotta go back to opera mini to access my fb account.
Alright i guess..lol
SGT 3 10.1. It opens then crashes after about 10 seconds. Sort it out Mark ;)
This keeps giving me statuses on my home page front 2 plus days prior instead of refreshing my intervals every 1 as set
Facebook keeps syncing my Facebook friends to my contact list in my phone. Even after I change it in the settings on Facebook! I need to uninstall the update until they fix this bug!
Good it is
Facebook apps keeps crashing. And it's the only app that keeps crashing
If I wanted to sync my contacts I would have. I think this is a beach of my personal information, Facebook should not make changes to your phone without asking. Updated the app is fine, but contacts are off limits. Now I have to go through my phone to delete all these dam duplicates!!!
Its nice to use for having communicate to each other!!!!
Bad
When request certain names of people to be removed from my list they tell me they are and then I start getting all of their games things and jumping games within one week
Keeps showing same posts after this last update.
Facebook
Synced all my contacts without asking not cool
So great I can download pics of them hot boys I like and also who cares if it does things like ex out all the time. At least it was freaking free!! I had an app that cost $29.56 and it never worked at all!!! So be happy Facebook is free!!
Top class

Most of the time when I try to watch a video it says "sorry, but an unknown error occurred while trying to play this video." Can you seriously fix it cause now it's getting really annoying. I've already reinstalled the app but it's still occurring. Can you guys seriously stop doing dumb updates and work on doing bug fixes.
The app freezes constantly.
Its good
Face is fun and fast
Faster everytime you updated it.
It won't let me download it
Love it just hate when dont load the news feed

Hi

Stop synching my contacts to my phone OMG!!!!!!! It is the worst when trying to find a person and you have to search/scroll through THOUSANDS of people. Its god awful and an absolute waste of energy. At the very least make it an option. When will you guys realize WE DON'T WANT FB INTEGRATED INTO OUR LIVES/CALLS/MSGS JESUS!!!!!!
I can't stand that they are forcing the install of messenger,I don't want to use it! Needs to be fixed where you don't have to install it!
It suck
Exilent
Very good social media
Nice

Syncing my contacts. I switch it to off and it turns itself back on.
Great
This Facebook update app 'SUCKS' . If I'm already sign up why do it again. Don't make sense
after all the updates?facebook is not working on my phone.gotta go back to opera mini to access my fb account.
Alright i guess..lol
SGT 3 10.1. It opens then crashes after about 10 seconds. Sort it out Mark ;)
This keeps giving me statuses on my home page front 2 plus days prior instead of refreshing my intervals every 1 as set
Facebook keeps syncing my Facebook friends to my contact list in my phone. Even after I change it in the settings on Facebook! I need to uninstall the update until they fix this bug!
Good it is
Facebook apps keeps crashing. And it's the only app that keeps crashing
If I wanted to sync my contacts I would have. I think this is a beach of my personal information, Facebook should not make changes to your phone without asking. Updated the app is fine, but contacts are off limits. Now I have to go through my phone to delete all these dam duplicates!!!
Its nice to use for having communicate to each other!!!!
Bad
When request certain names of people to be removed from my list they tell me they are and then I start getting all of their games things and jumping games within one week
Keeps showing same posts after this last update.
Facebook
Synced all my contacts without asking not cool
So great I can download pics of them hot boys I like and also who cares if it does things like ex out all the time. At least it was freaking free!! I had an app that cost $29.56 and it never worked at all!!! So be happy Facebook is free!!
Top class

Most of the time when I try to watch a video it says "sorry, but an unknown error occurred while trying to play this video." Can you seriously fix it cause now it's getting really annoying. I've already reinstalled the app but it's still occurring. Can you guys seriously stop doing dumb updates and work on doing bug fixes.
The app freezes constantly.
Its good
Face is fun and fast
Faster everytime you updated it.
It won't let me download it
Love it just hate when dont load the news feed

It constantly syncs phone numbers when I don't want anything synced. Lost count how many times over had to remove the sync 
Love it
I want those in browser tabs, not FB app. Better navigation, plus FB use, not either or. Revert, please!
Mine freezes just about everytime I'm on it.

Facebook has made this app very bulky and inconvenient to use in a low memory phone...
Since last update, fb crashes all the time. Have installed & uninstalled many times. Please help

Pushes about messages not letting u see them. Pushes about b days.  Pushes about not syncing. Pushes about pushes.
This app does not want to stay open now, once i open and it loads, it just forcecloses automaticly can you pls fix!!!

Syncing contacts to my phone automatically... not cool please fix
Legal 22
I'm having this problem where the application is automatically syncing my contacts.  Ive gone to the app and selected to not sync and an hour later it's synced again.  If this could get fixed I'd give 5 stars. But unsyncing my contacts multiple times a day is beginning to be a hassle
Since the new update it syncs all my contacts in my contact list in my phone!  Bye bye Facebook phone app!
Love facebook app
I used to like Facebook but now with the messenger incident and the contact sync. Facebook got on my nerves for the last Time I'm done. I'm un installing it. Bye facebook and hello instagram. I hope facebook dies and loses all of its fans
App shutsdown without warning or any signal.Not satisfied with the app at all.I urge the developers to immediately resolve this issue as soon as possible.
It had worked amazing till after the update .. The app close by itself
it does not work on mY samsung galaxy s3
Best
Good
It consumed way too much memory after just logged in and checked notification!! 
Good
ok
An absolute
The newest version of the app automatically syncs contacts to my phone. Even when I uncheck it in the app settings, every day it resets.
from the fb page in the play store, hit your menu key, the option to auto update with a box should appear, simply uncheck box. I have a Samsung galaxy ring.I just wish there was a way to uninstall updates like you can with factory loaded apps
Very nice on the G2
Kuat
its amazinq
Love it so much cold not face away from scree and crashed
Good
At first it was hard to understand what it wanted me to do but now I like this app best!!
I'm using Samsung s3 And there are no bugs just 1 star for no reason
Good
Takes too long to open and after it opens it crashes.
Try to do something good and useful. Updates given by u doesn't mean u r updated. Try to be updated.
Love
After the last update the app wont even open. Please fix this.
I love Facebook but sometimes it shows me Facebook is not responding, and that is very hectic for me.
Crashes on recent posts
My app for my Galaxy works better than the one on my IPad!  Updates and all!
Slow. Slow. Slooow. Made my phone freeze constantly. Uninstalled.
Facebook is Time pass Apps.
Decent app but when I click on a news story from another source inside of the Facebook app whenever I hit the back button it takes me to a blank grey or black page. Not sure how to correct or make the problem better
No space for small screen
It gets too slow most of the time..
Sehr gut
Loved it

Easy to use doesn't consume alot  of time
This new update (Version 19...)is automatically syncing Facebook contacts to my phone. If I wanted the contacts I would do it myself. I've taken them off 3 times already. If I have to again I'm uninstalling the app. Fix this!I had downgraded to older to fix this but facebook kindly update this issue asap
I am liking it..!
Can't get back to public chat on th messaging
Ever since my Galaxy tab 3 updated this app crashes all the time! How do I fix the problem? Did the uninstall/reinstall.

App disappeared from my phone
I have no time to look at pix of someone.  I don't know.  I don't need social media.  Sorryy, but I'm not the right guy for your survey
Awesome
I love it
Nice app
After the new update, it starts syncing my contacts without permission. Hate it.
Lol
Awesome
Got on my phone today (galaxy s4) and all of a sudden Facebook is automatically syncing all of my facebook contacts to my contacts on my phone!  I've gone and taken it off about 5 times and every time I reopen the app it does it again. PLEASE FIX THIS SOON!!!  If I wanted my FB contacts synced, I would do it myself!!  So irritating!!
Where are my uploaded videos gone and how to find them ?!
Nice app easy to use but consumes much memory
Working
MEET FRIEND &FAMAILY
Every time new update changes same, Worst app
Keeps closing by itself
I don't want my contacts synced with fb!!!
average
I understand that FB may need access to certain things but this app is not only constantly demanding more access to my personal information through updates but its doing it without my knowledge. You don't need to be able to read my text messages for any reason. Also I have had my settings changed several times. Just this morning my contacts were synced even though I have never synced them. I like the convenience of an app but I have had enough. I will just have to log in through my internet.
Ek no
same time it take to long to open and stopped i don't know why
Shitttt

when I try to open It immediately closes phone: doogee dg550
If I wanted to to sync my fb friends contact information to my phone I would do that on my own. I select the, "don't sync" option and it does it anyways. I have done this multiple times and it still syncs them. I am not a fan of this new update. Please fix it before everyone deletes the app.
All contacts synced from FB to my contacts on my phone.
Too much crash and laggy on my S3mini Please update !
great
Try Facebook.
Always good service
Facebook, please make your app less resource intensive and make it so that it does NOT run in the background at all.
This is the best app but first we have download the videos but now not possible to download any video plz do this tnx
The more it keeps updating the more its getting slower and slower. Honestly sometimes these updates are just useless if its like this.
It's suck it only working good in the begining and then I had so much problem opening it kept say login when try sign in it kept saying wrong password I had no problem sign online but the apps on my phone is suck this the second time that I have to unstall facebook from my addroid I don't even know if I will download this apps in the future.
Excellent

Sucks!
Crashes on opening. Have not been able to use it even once!
cool
I am just download this fb apps  very slow downloding.
I don't care what anyone says....Facebook....you don't know what i consider top story...so why do I have to go through several clicks to get to the most recent on my wall? Also, put my friends list back in alphabetical order...it's quicker and simpler to find people. Thank you... that is all.
All that I need to read..all that I need to talk..all that I need to see..everything that I need to know!!!
Good
It is OK it makes me mad
Great! Very convenient and reliable :)
Works gud fr me..
Usefull

I can't remove any photo comment or comment from my own post. Make an update on that.
work very slowly and not loading news and taking lots of time even when network is also ok
Loving it
Suparr
Why is it necessary to download the messenger?
This is by far the worst app that I attempt to use on any device. It is extremely resource intensive and phenomenally unstable. This app leaks memory worse than a wiffle ball holds water. Terrible. Don't bother installing this garbage, use a web browser instead.
Fb is use all....
Super
Previous version was good... the contacts are getting synchronized as I m logging in... plz change this update... removing till that time...
For older version
I love fb
Not working well
Idk its good
No option of copy-paste. No access to other folders. Delayed feeds
Facebook ver. 2.0 is greatly improved by developer , but improve the app for save in sd memory it's take more memory in my phone and slow down my phone so please help me developer pls impove it for stored in sd slot. ...    thanks...
Good!
Uninstalling facebook. Too much space and too many special permits for me. So sad.
Very good
If you're lucky enough, like me, to have a phone that will allow you to uninstall app updates and revert the app to it's factory state, then I would advise you to do so. I did, and now my facebook app never asks me to download messenger, and performs only the most basic functions, which is the way it should be. If you can't uninstall updates, just uninstall the app all together and use your phone's web to go to the facebook site directly.
Awesome
I go to open the Facebook app and it pulls up and it says setting up Facebook and then it just closes. Ive uninstalled reinstalled ive rebooted my phone ive restarted it and ive done just about everything and it still wont work. My phone is a Samsung galaxy ring can someone please help me. It's making me really angry!!!!!!!
i use note 2 & suffer everytime i open fb

Not that bad but is useful enough
Why are you syncing friends to my contacts? Leave the bloody thing alone ffs
Good
Every time I try to do a comment, I get dumped out of Facebook.
I like it
I'm really starting to hate Facebook period. The update do much more bad then good. I don't want all of my Fb friends in my personal contacts.
Fb
Every time i comment on a post its hung why?even when i send messages too!!
Awesome.
New Update takes a long time for setup every time and force closes itself..                                                            Useless App from a Billionaire's Firm!

Even with WiFi or high signal this app takes forever to load a comment or a pic or even a notification... Hate this app
A game spelling words and connecting them together.
Veary good life
The best way to keep up with family
I dont like fb updating my contacts, i turn it off and it turns on by itself...  this is annoying
Love facebook
After the recent update it has changed the permissions and synced FB to my contacts without asking. When I get time I think I'll try Friendcaster or something. Already uninstalled the annoying messenger. The whole thing is becoming too intrusive and likes to think that your phone is made for FB.
Force closed :'(
Duper
Awesome
Can't download. :(
Super
Sory not like now
It won't find my account! On My laptop I can go on my profile but here I can't!  My username is Klaudia Tr if that information is useful so please help me!
Keeps shutting down
My tablet do not like last version.  When opening notifications it close facebook
Dis new update automatic syncs all.my contacts make me have an panic attack wid wats goin wrng wid my phne.. Older version lot better....
Randomly force closes for no reason.
Best Choice ever
Soooooo nice
It's not logging me out is taking me back to same page I logged out from them gives me error message
The app continues to run in the backround even after backing all the way out. Never has before. Have to use app killer to completely close it every time. Nice try... FIX IT!
Way better off going through the website if you have to use FB

Facebook
Boring it was for chastine and my mum
Giving more flexibility than before ....great app. ...I love it..
I like it because in this we can kiss girls online :-) :D
Excellent application
IS IT TOO FREAKING MUCH TO ASK FOR SORTING THE COMMENTS WITH MOST LIKES?
I'm happy with Facebook
If you want to be a guinea pig, facebook is the perfect place
I hate that I have to go on the internet-based site or download another app just to see my messages.... If I can't see them then who's watching it? I only keep this app now due to the games I play and even still it's not worth it
Great.

App sucks now it keeps syncing my contacts after I have changed it where they dont. Why don't you guys fix the bugs before you keep adding crap. Fix it please. Galaxy S4

I don't want to give even a single star one of the 2013 was ok but nowadays version are  like hell , it always shows setting up or works very slowly and my Phone displays app doesn't work even though all my other app works properly so whatever the problem is fix it

K
This app works great on my samsung galaxy s 5 this is a good app to keep in contact with good family and friends of course it has its flaws but overall it is great
you should make it faster and less force closing guys !!
Until you allow messaging back into this app, I'm giving you 1 star. Why should I have to download the a separate app for messages. If people want that, then let them. But don't take the messaging function away from the main Facebook app.               Still doesn't always show the news feed in chronological order from newest to oldest. Also, I shouldn't have to download the messenger app to see my messages. 1 app for all of Facebook. I click on turn off notifications for certain posts, but still get them
That Ryan Gosling wih a  beard??(; lmao Good app tho yall haha
If i log out i have to uninstall the app then reinstall in order to log back in.
I noticed that iPhone users can reply to comments. Why can't we? Also, since new update, I can't turn off contact sync. I don't need all of my Facebook friends in my contacts! It's annoying! And cannot delete, they just show up again
It ( app not responding, error loading news feed, ) right in the med of what I am doing. Some times it goes back to reloading facebook.
nyssss
I love india
Good for friends
I don't get events and birthday updates automatically, I have to check it manually. More over some performance are annoying.
After samsung update, app closes when I click on any comments.   Very annoying,  uninstalling and reinstalling to see if it helps

Stop force contacts
I keep getting knocked off why
Stop forcing me to get messenger!!!! I hate that thing
very slow
<3
This sucks..........
not ok
Hate it. Have to uninstall it in order to log out. Takes a million tries to log in. Most of the time "FACEBOOK" is not responding "force close" !!! Please fix and go back to original fb.
Lovely apps
Large chunks of time missing on timeline, need to clear data all the time for it to download a fresh, very frustrating, this is more prevalent when using most recent. Also uses far too much memory usage especially since messenger has to be installed separately, my phone memory is nearly full, so have to clear Facebook data almost daily. Not fit for purpose. Forgot to mention videos don't work either...
Good but the last updates have not brought anything new. Your not fooling anyone
My love
Should be able to delete your profile.

Still dosnt run to good on Gingerbread, even after the latest update ( 14/3/14). Uninstall the app then rein install it or you can try uninstalling the updates ..which i did ..and it works ok now. Hate the suggested pages, hate the push to join Facebook messenger ..leave it out ffs !!!
The best to be connected with family members! !!
Wtf y daily new updates
Why does FB friends have to b added into my phone contacts tho. Is it that serious. Smh.. Can we just update it without all that? Smh

Ok
People still can see me online while use phone. Just remove the 1hour ago or 1day ago on chat list. I don't want people know what times i log in.
Excellent app
Latest update really sucks , it doesn't work properly . When i start using this app ,  it suddenly stops i don't know what has happened to it so please try to fix it.............
What's going on fb, just updated today, and my news feeds  stucks since morning, it's totally sucks,,, pls do something about it
Phone state and identity permission goes too far. Uninstalling.
This new update is automatically syncing Facebook contacts to my phone. If I wanted the contacts I would do it myself. I've taken them off 3 times already. If I have to again I'm uninstalling the app. Fix this!
sure in?
Yadav
Hy
I wish it would actually keep my setting to show "most recent" first instead of me having to change it every time.
Great
Uninstalled and reinstalled and same problem. Cannot roll back
Since the latest update this app keeps changing my contacts settings.... I don't want Facebook in my contacts!
Very good
Farisha
Its good buddy
Where is my recent pictures?
i hate it coz im offline yet they see me online.. is there something wrong with my phone?
Nice app.. Bug fixed.. Great experience..
Fantastic
It never showed the new information. It shows me things people post 3 days early
Not so good.
Loading of pics is so slow
i want a new version
Fluida e veloce anche se alcune volte perde colpi
Nawaz
always lag....
nice apps
It helps me alot
Excellent but need more updating
I use face book every day on my tab it is fast and good for browsing.
Don't know what happened a few updates ago but you used to be able to put your news feed to most recent so it would be in chronological order. I'm sorry I don't need to see a post from 5 days ago when I already saw it. Sometimes I can't even find a recent post that I just saw and want to click or comment on because the news feed will reset and then the post is lost since you can't put everything in chronological order. Fix this please.
Most recent option not there....
Super
Only time passsssss
It always hang while u to sign.
Fb
Don't care for the new messenger otherwise it would get five stars.
It does what I want without too much grief
My.facebook ready block i need take back can you please help me....to take back my.facebook.....
Its funny how my "Most recent stories" are posts from 3-8 hours ago, and I don't get notifications from my friends, even the "Close" ones. This app just gets worse and worse with each update.
Automatically turn off after few seconds! !
Amazing app provide easy and fast access of Facebook.. Just only one thing should be there that app should provide the copy facility of others status.
Marvellous
Sometimes its closed by it self
Hanipajally
Good like it beter like others
Since the last update I'm facing the problem. WiFi & mobile data is working with other applications but this Facebook is not loading the news feed. Plz make a fix.
I am trying to update the app but there is an error while updating.
Can't use it. Keeps dropping. Can't see comments. Very frustrating. Please fix. Contacted FB several times re problems. No response.
Good Good Good
The update was really good but something that I don't like is its auto sync by default
Facebook is a great app but I don't like the fact that it syncs my contacts!! 
Stupid auto sync.

Nice
Whenever I try to 'like' a post, the app automatically scroll up to the next post and I did not manage to 'like' it.
It is more reliable in new version (Samsung galaxy grand 2 )
I have been using fb since 4years and i have lot of fun and i come to know very much from fb its useful,entertaining and best
App fb naic
SD card
Photos and video thumbnails stop loading agreed going through a few posts!! I have to clear the app from the RAM and speed browse to previously read post to catch up. And now all posts are in some different order. STOP YOUR SHITTY PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS and get this app working.
Great app for browsing must of the time, however forcing us to use the spyware messenger app in the newest version is a crap move Facebook. Also when new updates are available in the news feed, it scrolls to a different position which is very annoying
I would like to work with it!
Nice:-)  misdong 'add tag' on tagged posts
Pls fix this update
Can't open my facebook since last night. Other websites are ok and fast.
Doesn't open at all
This is a very bad app why becoz this app will motivate to install facebook messenger of 10 mb of data
My Facebook app doesn't work it opens. And if I scroll,like try to comment or share it shuts down itself. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled....now I've officially uninstalled.
Always Facebook isn't responding and always hard to login and another one Facebook is setting up and it say just a moment then it crash.

A fine cool & a fast app in google play store
But there is no change in ui.. Please make it as material design.
The new, incredibly obnoxious "feature" that shoves a popup down your throat gratuitously telling you who among your friends like the site that you just shared something from may be the last straw that makes me finally DUMP FACEBOOK. At the very least, I will not be sharing much, certainly not from their mobile craplication.
very Nice
My pages hardly ever load it's beyond annoying.
wonderful
Very good aap
Bring back the messages.
Don't really like it.  Have deleted and don't plan on downloading it again
Excellent
Its a good app just that sometimes it won't let me see my messages
Need to stop sync by its self cuz I dont want it to sync with my contacts
Older version.. If i logout i will restart my phone coz i cannot log in anymore
yeah
Good
Good but not exilent
So beatifull
Great but it is getting larger size every update,i dont have much space on my phone,plz do something about it
Er
Beautiful
FB is way too up in my chili and needs to step back. Change messenger already! New version is terrible.
Ghana
A handy use only.. keeps me updated. Not amazingly good.
I don't want to sync my facebook contacts to my phone and I do not want my facebook contacts to appear in whatsapp even after selecting the option to not sync my facebook data with my phone but somehow facebook keeps changing the setting on its own. That's too creepy. Uninstalling facebook till you fix or remove this feature.
Quit gud
So good
Speechless
Supper
Privacy Custom setting is only via Web browser. Facebook app android can not privacy Custom setting.
It keeps auto syncing my contacts and every time I take the auto sync off it does it again. This needs to be fixed as getting quite annoying now !!!
Looks awful on a galaxy tab s, just a badly stretched mobile version. Nicer on iPad
Good
I want to uninstall the last few updates. DON'T INSTALL. JUST USA YOUR WEB BROWSER.

When i log out my account i cant log it out
Every single time I get out of stupid facebook app it automatically sync's to my phone w all facebook contacts and pictures even though I went in settings and fixed it ever since this early a.m. update. I have to keep going in settings and fixing it. I deleted the app and no long will be on facebook until you fix it! Updates are suppose to fix the problems not make it worse!
Love it

Stupid 'top news feed stories'! So unimportant feature! Make most recent as default!!

I feel Facebook is human lifeline it becomes live happy life.
Good
Marie
Can't even get into my page with it saying facebook is not responding.
Still Rubbish! Most of us have to or need to use this app but its functionality, reliability and customer support can only be described as 'Poor'. [It now uses 173MB of memory.] How much more space do you want?
Facebook has a mind of its own it automatically updates and decideds to sync all of my contacts seriously im dont with Facebook. !! Please remove!
Your popup message is ridiculous as it is repetitive. Everytime it pops up it freezes the whole app and you can't do nothin till it goes away.If I'm in the middle of typing a message it will pop me out of the keyboard and I have to reengage to continue typing.This is absolutely aggravating its like you guys don't test things before you update the app. And you stilI haven't done anything to fix the picture sharing feature within the app. My phone sends Facebook notifications I don't need another one.
good app
Mobile app crashes or is "forced to close"
Tired of updating once a week. That's been happening alot lately.
I do not want my contacts to be synced I actually hate having that. It was completely fine until this last update. Please fix.
Blahhhh
Keep getting kicked out. Please fix the update for tablet users thanks.

Super fine social network aap
Please my facebook it automatically updated and decides to sync all of my contacts seriously im dont with Facebook..please remove
Good apps

Huh pathetic
Can't turn off auto sync to contact. Each time I turn it off, then automatically sync again. Its very annoying.
I can see notifications but my news feed just keeps trying to load with no results.
Always update. But nothing can see. Sigh 
Whenever I download it it stucks on 93 % so kindly fix it
Kkeps on closing on my all the time. About to go back to myspace.
I had no complaints until Facebook FORCED us to use the Spyware Messenger app!!!
Good
It best as Facebook have become a common thing to people . Many people uses facebook to get friend and chat in facebook like talking in realife. In my opinon, Facebook is on of the application that is the best as it have many function . Nothing wrong with the app . Good to use . I will continue support your customer services and recommend it to my friend who are young and have not created facebook .Thank you :)
Can't use it closes all the time, samsung galaxy tab 3
A good social app
Gud
speed is Okey.. but it Consumes very much data
This is a great app for keeping up with Facebook posts, and most basic Facebook needs. But i still don't get why i can't reply to comments like i can do on my desktop? It's a real hindrance when you're trying to have a conversation on a page. Do add this feature.
Facebook is crashing seriously after update
It has the majority of features that website does, although it is more limited.
Its fun because you can text there friends, also people can like your picture or the states and Facebook it my world I just live it
Nt good

App ever
Keeps closing and is slow irk what is wrong fix hopefully

That  specail people
Keeps shutting down whenever i share or look at anything. You removed messenger and fucked the system up. Your updates continually add bullshit that you dont need or want and increasingly worse to navigate.  As soon as someone creates a like app im switching along with everybody i know.
A very good app to reach out to your friends.
Not bad :-)

Plz correct the tag process while we tag a photo only 50 not much more....
I had it on my phone. It took forever to logout and also caused problems with my calls and texts.
the facebook chat doesnt give you privacy esp when someone open your cp or tab they can easily access your personal messages.
I love keeping in touch with friends and family and this app works wonders. Thank you
Its good and bad in tha same time

MOST RECENT ERROR
Very fast
After seconds of being open, it closes. Useless. Still, even after 3 updates, all i get is a black screen and it closes. Not even worth it. Used to work great, now it's useless. Uninstalling.
This facebook can not even install in my phone..its only showing package file invalid
FB
I tend to use this app to find and keep up with folks I know.  Handy app!
Many crash when I play video
Way too slow. No integrated messaging. App permissions are out of control. Interface is a complete unintuitive mess. How a company this big can produce such terrible software is beyond me.
Id like to view most recent updates instead of having fb timeline show me whatever it feels like.
With all these reliability and speed updates, I'd expect it to be fast by now
it helpe us to talk with anyone
I can't begin to tell you how many facebook users you have lost over your stupid chat, I know u lost me off of chat, now ur making money off of me with your adds. Can't u leave a good thing alone? Your not making things better your just being greedy!
Nice

I don't like coz its so poor apps !!!
I like it...
The whole world is hooked onto FB. Am not the exceptional.

Hi

Facebook keeps synchronizing with my contacts even when I turn it off
Messanger
Change the icon
Facebook is syncing contact automatically though I have set it don't sync
This app is slowing my device.It is heating up my phone after using it just for 5 min.And the User Interface is outdated and has got more bugs.Fix it Facebook team and mail us so we can reinstall it again.
Why can't we default to latest updates in the timeline, why would I want to see stuff from ages ago that I don't care about?

It was getting better, but they lost it again... Pathetic move to force us use the CRAP facebook messenger app in order to see our messages!!! I dont want to use this app ( and i will not to) in order to see my messages! Dont like this "forcing" thing... Praying Google for a 0 star option right now.
Very useful.

Seemingly cannot share spotify songs to facebook, always says post failed
New version says it's 19.28Mb but somehow this has been turned from app content (which could be stored on an sd card) to processing content (which can't be stored on an sd card).  The app now takes up so much phone memory, I can't have any other apps at all & even with that it runs slow all the time.  Please resolve asap!!!!
Very nice

App has not loaded my newsfeed or notifications for at least a week. Tried restarting app and device (verizon LG tablet) didn't work. Same story with clearing the data and cache. Tried force stopping app, still not working. Uninstall and reinstall the app, not it either. The app works on my S3 but I would enjoy being q ble to utilize my tablet.
Sometimes it's good

Uninstall, bye!
Great app but too much updates make it impossible to use it for low speed connections....also own wall is difficult to view and make changes
To many lagging.. Fix it

Its a good app has problems signing in and out of my account sometimes though
Stop auto syncing contacts in my address book! I don't want that feature and never wanted to use it. I disable the feature but it just turns itself back on. 1 star because of this.

Again after the new update Again  sucks over its brings old news feed from weeks ago now where the top stories and most stories went I down my rate to 1 stars u administration's what u reads nothing from users comments fix the wrong we want the feeds back
This app is now too big to install on my 2yr old phone. If you created a facebook 'lite' app, I think more people would want it.
Please up date again and fix this problem App tries to open but fails and have to force close
App works great, except for auto-play videos. They freeze up the app. Need a way to turn off this "feature".
Unload problem
Love it
I can't download it without my phone hanging and it stopping android core processes.

Doesnt show the 'other' messages section. No option for copying part of any text, have to open fb in a browser to do so. Messenger within the fb app was way more convinient until u decided to separate it :-/  -HTC Butterfly S

Since the latest update, my facebook app has been crashing constantly. It crashes at least 3 times every time I go use facebook. This is getting really old and needs to be fixed.

I'll continue to give this one star til you put messaging function back into the main app. Not downloading another app. I've been just going to Facebook in my browser j stead of this cheesy app.

Lian Carl M Fernandez
Mmmssst    app..
My biggest gripe with the app is the fact that I have to dig through the latest reviews to see what has actually changed with each update. Facebook app release managers either don't know the difference between a major functional change and a "performance enhancement" or they're just being flat out intellectually dishonest in hope that people won't choose not to update. Google really should have a policy against this.

Love it
please new version to update anD please stop auto sync
Not a single one of your users is interested in your "Top Stories" bs, we want option to have Most Recent permanently. One star until we get it.

This app stopped displaying photos on my phone for a week now. Please fix it now.
Facebook looks at everything you do and can take pictures of you seems a bit creepy
Everytime i update it still looks the same
Its abit slow

Since email changed, I cannot even log back in to change it to the current email. Won't recognize my phone number anymore, and my password doesn't work(even after trying to change it) Im done with Facebook, I guess.
I don't like
Synced all the facebook numbers that I do not need or wanted to my contacts.. its really bugging me having everyone's info that I didnt have for a reason! Please fix this soon!!
Nice
Cool..

I've taken email off my tablet, so no longer worry about FB sending emails without my permission, but still, when I'm scrolling through my feed, articles will vanish, and it will randomly jump from a post I'm trying to read, right back to the top, so I have to scroll through hundreds of posts to find it again. Not user friendly, bloody annoying.

This is awesome aaps. This apps are very important quote in life
this app so suckss...very slow and bugs a lot.
When uploading and saving pictures to device, they aren't in high resolution. Fix it.
There is still no SD card option for this app. I guess the only people this company listens are the iPhone users in the state of California. I still like the app though I think this company still needs to take the California blinders off & accept all reviews for this app that aren't disrespectful. I would hope the users of this app wouldn't rant so much & respect the developers of an app that I consider good to have despite the unresolved problem caused by the lack of SD card option.
5-STAR.Its a nice social page to make news and many more but some time some people are really  disturbed.fix my all problem please

Pls update it. It is starting to take too  much time to open the app and most of the time freezes and is way too slow.
Newsfeed isn't up to date ... I want to see today's update not 2 days ago update....cant edit a comment...cant delete a comment...holy crap everything ....and this app uses a lot  of RAM Memory...it is too big App for smaller devices....I dnt wanna even rate 1 star...
People say this App steals personal information, but it doesn't with mine, false info comes in handy. This app keeps me in touch with friends and family.
You updated the app but it did not fix the automatic shutting down the app does when I leave the News Feed part.
Nice.
You need to fix app it keeps automatically syncing with my contacts even though I check do not sync I have to go unsync it daily
B'days are synced to calendar but I'm not seeing any option to wish b'days using this app.
the best
God gud
It is sexy
Ilove this app
Everybodies doin so y not join...
The new flatter UI is nice, but you know what is STILL missing? A freaking tablet layout.  What we have now is literally just a blown-up version of the phone app. The iPad version has always taken advantage of the extra screen real estate, so the only reasonable conclusion I can make is that the Facebook devs are lazy when it comes to Android.
I give 1 star, because i tagged some photos but it did'nt work. How come! Can u fix it.
The best app
Like it

There's a progress

This app is useful for us but there is too many Bugs. I can't see Most Recent posts in new update and even I am not updates with this app.

First the whole messenger debacle, then disabling recent posts, now Facebook wants to data mine your phone without permission, and pollute your phone with contacts, again without permission.  Uninstalled, uninstalled, and uninstalled, once for each of my devices.

I call B.S on the 20 mbs it's actually 162 mbs and you can't even move the stupid app over to external micro sd card either. So there for it just keeps eating up you internal memory with every update.
so slow and so ugly on tablet!
It's the iconic fb app but it keeps freezing and crashing. It's beyond ridiculous. I'm so irritated with it. I have for force stop ALL of my apps, occasionally it fixes the problem. I'm thoroughly unimpressed.
It takes so long the start up, it says "setting up Facebook"and after five minutes, finally log in, please fix it
my app aint loading it keeps saying to RETRY
Facebook number one :)
Add some new features like status copy...
Only reason I have a Facebook is because society demands it.
I will try this app. If its working:/

You made a big mistake by inventing the messenger app. Stop syncing contacts to my phone.

Thanks Facebook for FORCING me to look at suggested pages every time I share a post on my Galaxy note 2..     I REALLY APPRECIATE IT !!! ! :) :)
The facebook app is getting worse and worse with every update, video cant play through without giving an error
nice
The permissions on this app is ridiculous! I've deleted the messenger app as well. Go figure, my phone runs much better when someone isn't remotely accessing it. I've checked my account just fine through my phone's browser but mobile Facebook has been acting up. Probably cause they're trying to force people like me to download the app again. And it almost worked until I got here and read an old review. Then I did a review of the app permissions....and that settled it. I won't be downloading this app again.
Everytime I get on facebook it crashes right away. I can't do anything. It either crashes before my newsfeed pops up or as soon as I touch anything. Please fix this.
Png
An app that does its work but. is not especially good. Needs bug fixes to solve crashes and data usage to be improved.
I was addicted to FB because of this app..
KEEP CRASHING CRASHING CRASHING...

so drwn my data n can be quickly?
Features don't mean anything. If you got no spyne.
What?? I need to download messenger so I can send my messages?? My phone doesn't have anymore space! 
Good
Nice app
If you go to your application manager and look up the Facebook app and the permissions it has on your phone you will realize it has the permission to do far too many unnecessary breaches of peivacy which causes me to question just what Facebook is all about. Like seriously why does it need the ability to read and send SMS text messages without the host's acknowledgement. Wtf... and that is just one of the fucked up ones. There is many more.
Wast
Irritating how your app automatically syncs contacts restore back the old settings where we can personalise em for ourselves to our own desires work on it asap
Much better than using browsers
Only complaint is that I'd like to be able to tag pages. Not just friends.
please can you faster..
This version is ok as related to speed and stability but this app makes compulsory to install messanger, we can't read message from application,  but for those users who can't run messanger due to RAM,  ITS TOTALLY CRAP.
Problem is If i wanna set a profile pic which is already in my profile pictures folder than it automatically creates the copy of that pic to set as a profile pic.
Come on... Its facebook! 
Bluetooth
very handy......
I Hate the new Facebook App It Does Not  let you show most recently post's.
Good
I keep setting up my Facebook contacts to no syncing but it syncs anyways without my permission.
Hey Facebook, stop changing my settings.  I do not want my contacts synced, I do not want videos to auto play, and I do not want to use your browser.  Stop inserting your fingers into places they do not belong!!!!
Good
One of the best socializing apps around
The best form to stay update
Exciting
Excellent
Good for right now
.Makes you have to download messenger also you cannot switch between recent updates and most popular
Its a good way to connect with other friends and to meet new people.
Wow! But the wall is boring me because everyone sees what you have written
No skits, no mess ups. Its all good
I am intelligent
Checked out new settings !
Its a little better now

Crashes nearly every time I click on a news feed or try to comment or share.  Now it crashes nearly any time I scroll near an imbedded video.  Worked fine prior to the last 2 or 3 updates. I will never use the new messenger app.

How can such a popular service have such a bad android client? Huge (it's a glorified RSS reader, get real), slow (is it so hard to keep locally cached thumbnails?), dysfunctional, inconsistent (some popups are animated and elastic, others are not, etc), confusing (not clear what is and what is not a button nor what it will do)... update: nothing significant changed.
Its awsome
Amazing!!!!!
Replaces the personal connection. Not for me. I use this app once or 2x a week.... Im speaking about those tons of people i see in the streets, restaurants, homes and school's with their phone on their faces looking at no one but the phone. Sad sad sad.
I don't like the new update it makes me feel bad....because sometimes it doesn't work. Please fix it!!! i uninstall  the app.  I hate it.
Brilliant

Dear facebook love ur app but hate the fact the u now have to load the messenger app just to see ur messages. Did it ever occur to u that some people might not have the best android phone an memory space is a problem. Now i cant view my messages.
Please add video download option
Im unable to watch videos on facebook it plays for a while then freezes and the sound goes on for a while longer after this it stops the video and says "an error occurred"
Way too much access requested with suspicious permissions.
KEEP It Up
Excellent
Good
V n a
Suck, it closes out and i cant do nothing but look, they need to fix this. Started when we had to add the messager
The new update keeps syncing facebook information to my phone after I have told it not to. I do not want all on my facebook information synced with my phone! Please fix.
Perfect
Liked it
I am grateful for helping me understanding my device A+

Now auto suggested ad videos will play on my mobile data, even when auto play on WiFi only is enabled. Also, I keep having to trick the app into messaging because its trying to force migrate me. Not happening.
Best app
Its good to be able to see what family are doing that live far from you Its nice to have.
I like but still improve
is there anyway i can get it back to the old one lol

Please include reply feature in comments.
To large for someone who doesn't have funds for a new phone. Maybe you should make an alternative update. For newer phones and older phones. Just an entrepreneur idea. Thanks :)
Its got more speed and it updates faster
Good app but slow asf
Won't let me play videos all the way through. Will freeze half way through but play sound. I have a Sony xperia. Please  help. It has done this for too long now no matter how often I update! Phone is utd
Who doesn't have facebook nowadays lol even my grandparents have an fb account

Swallow a lot of ram. 15-20Mb ram when running
The app keeps signing out after a while then keeps saying starting up ,just a moment ,don't know why the app is not staying signed on and it is slow.
Needs to stop freezing up & crashing!!!
Nice boss
Uravashi
Each time it is more than one persons birthday, it comes up with [name] and 3 others have birthdays but when you click on it, it comes up with whos birthday is coming up, I always want to know who those other people who have birthdays are but I can't!
First search, now messenger, I'm beginning to wonder if this is worth keeping.  The newest trick is to constantly show a notification for the messenger app I don't want to use.

Good
You added a browser now? Get rid of it! You idiots don't realize that certain links function with other apps on our phones?! It's yet another function that isn't wanted. Guess what? I've effectively abandoned Facebook. I'm on Google+ more now. I'm no longer updating your app either.
I've had an all around great experience with it it's fun to keep in touch and share photos and videos with family and friends and find new friends with similar interests
love it
One thing ppl you didn't be friended can still go into your page and see your comments...and on my profile my pictures keep desapearing:-(
Would be five if it would give me most recent status and not yesterday or the other day all the time
I don't understand how u need an I'd I gave u the id and u say it's not state id
Dont like this update. Layout is horrible, and the app auto closes after 5 seconds. No good at all.
Enjoy
Most profile pictures don't even load this app isn't even that awesome
Hmmm ok
This app won't install to the sd card and takes up all my phones memory.... read the bad reviews. It does what it wants removing the app
Keeps closing
Keep it up
one of the best versions of fb..... love it... keep it up ...
awallllllllllaaaaaa
Cannot save the picture? Why????????? Tell me....
I am an editor to a community page and there is no option through this app to switch from posting/liking as the page to posting/liking as myself! This needs to be addressed!!!!
It is getting worse and worse and worse...
Thanks
Gud app for using fb
I really like it.....
Must have it
Good
Lagging, it took time to load; when I am uploading pictures, lagging also. 
HTC wildfire A3333
Good app
I love fb
I keep putting dont sync contacts and i keep getting contacts added
Loved this mobile APP
Love it
Sync contacts without permission! !
Lack of speed
Most of the time when I 'click on' a link within the Facebook app, I get the following message "unfortunately Android System has stopped". This happens on both WiFi AND 4G. This even happens less than two hours after restarting my phone, so please don't blame THAT. Also, it takes up quite a bit of storage space, not everyone has an IPhone, Facebook!
Latest update doesn't allow pinch and zoom on photos. If I wanted tiny pics I'd be on instagram. Please fix.
It's a completely satisfactory app. The UI can be better. Feels a bit too iPhone for my taste. Going material design might help this app a lot.
Superb
I DONT WANT TO DOWNLOAD ANOTHER APP JUS SO I CAN RECEIVE MESSAGES!!!
keeps foreclosing. fix asap.
This will help me understand about my android and help toupdate newer betad.
I have to Uninstal and reinstall in order to message someone and I don't want it to keep telling me to go to the messenger
Excellent
I got a new phone and now have the newer app. It is SLOOOOW! Pictures never seem to load and I'm connected to wi-fi and everything. Hope the app has better performance soon.
Is a good app this app help me what everyone is doing on their time off lol!!!!
Great
App has glitches. Though very addictive.
The next big thing is here and Facebook is making that possible.....
Better, still hate messenger, but performance is decent
Nice
Everytime I use it,its always not responding and I can't update it due to ab error what the f**ck !Try to read all of the rate, reviews and comments that you have all of them is bad news
Google+ is sooo much better.. Everyone should check it out...
Coool
When the app launched , it always says "Setting up facebook" And "Just a moment" After that it crashes and need to force close , Fix it and i give atleast 4 stars
What was once so simple and friendly has become complicated and aggressive. The notifications I receive have no rhyme or reason. I'm turning them off completely and may resort to removing the app entirely if the system footprint does not diminish further.
News feeding problem. 2 days back news feed now.
Awesome
So much better than before!
Its going to work as well as facebook wants to.
Tired of the news feed always out of orders. Postings from 3 days show up as recent. Guess they don't have testers,
Automatically syncs contracts with android no matter how many times I tell it to delete data and not sync.
I liked it....its really gd
Nice
I lv it
good
I don't need 2 sync my Facebook account fix it 2 where it dont do this

After latest update, I can't do anything in Facebook.  Every time I open the app, it closes after about 5 seconds.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, same problem.  Can't change any settings on it so had to delete the app.  Won't reinstall until I hear the bug is fixed and that contacts aren't synced to phone.

I don't like it when it sincs my contacts. Call from someone through inbox is very irritating.
Waw
The app is so slow. And it crashes as it loading up my news feed. It has done this a lot and I have reported it and I have seen no changes.
Awesome
Not giving permission. Literally undoing it every 30 minutes or so.
I DO NOT WANT MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS SYNCED TO MY PHONE! I keep on turning it off but it continuously syncs my contacts! Stop it. This is extremely frustrating.
is incapable to make a decent app that is without glitches... Mindboggling!
Great
Muy bueno
Not updating. It works just fine enough for me anyways. It nowhere mentions that it's going to sync my contacts to fb. And it seems all those 1 star reviews aren't making any impact upon the app ratings as of now. Hmmm...
Has a bug that need to be fix basically its wack
Like it
Facebook, you keep getting more dumb each update. Every update I get has always something I don't like at all. This udate, is syncing ALL my contacts with my permission and when, I change the setting to take it off it takes all my contacts away.
Hai
Updated the app and now my widget doesn't work.
Very time it take long time to log in n also in checking the post , very slow .1 star
1 Star for the Facebook messenger. Don't need that extra app on my phone...
Why Is Facebook Getting Slower ?
Earliar i use to download photos in a high quality but now i cannot do that......the photos r not in high quality...and yes its working in my smartphone very slowly......
I love it so much
However when Im using the Facebook, it alway closes itself.  Have to reopen app and delete all app on my screen.
But add where I can reply to comments
Pretty good app but just SUCKS for a tablet. First make a decent tablet app and then go for all these "game changing" Home Launchers and stuff
bad ads
Still i like this app it is so good and affordable to me.
Why can't I download this app!!??!! It was giving me problems so I uninstalled it and now I can't reinstall it!! Why?!?!
I like
I am addicted with this app
Epa
Facebook just did the worst update and automatically added pictures to every contact and added anyone who's number I didnt have..thats like borderline creepy that it has access to do that
Wait 4 new ver
Getting longer time to open.
Bring back messaging in the app
Thanks for fixing the login and log out issue with the time it took. I am much happier. Just keep on inporving. The reason why its not a five is still is very slow and doesn't want too load right.
Easier way to connect with people in this Fastest life.
No zoom option I can't copy text please try to update these things
Add A Section Where You Can Find Videos
Every once and awhile it won't let me click on any new tags, posts, messages,ect.but again, that's slim to none.i do wish i could save a picture rather then screen shot everything.other then that.it's great
Working good for now.

Have to wait at least 5 minutes to get it started.
Facebook as kicked me off 3 * already. And then by security day want me to show a government issue I d. Don't you think that's un safe? And I had to uninstall it and now reinstall it for the third time and not and not even sure if I'm going to be able to use my real name and real information because they add said my facebook profile is temporarily blocked for some on known reason. You guys better fix this problem because otherwise I'll be dropping facebook all together.
It sync by itself and i hate it
Good
Its improving
Needs more updates the app keeps on crashing on me and I have an s5 so please fix
khans
Always crashes when i click on a notification
It used to lag really bad but now it's a whole lot better and faster. Just wished it didn't take up so much space on my phone.
App will be deleted until it stop syncing my fb with my phone contacts on its own the updates are horrible!
Needs to fix glitch with syncing contacts I've turned it off four times and it keeps auto syncing and it's pushing me to the point of deleting it
Good
Very bad apps ever I seen.....I used it in my Samsung grand. .& in always crashed....problm to log in,, problm to loading, ...only view nice..work bad....so I decide to uninstall it.........solve this problem. ..
It works wonders fr me personally n ive ask mi frends to try it
I noticed that iPhone users can reply to comments. Why can't we?
Facebook app
Very nice
Not happy.  I've had this app on every device and this it's the first one that it doesn't work on  I've uninstalled it 3 times.  As soon as you choose a page, picture or notification it shuts down.  Aggravating
I prefer to use messenger on Facebook and not have a separate app for it. It's wasting space. Plus I have had people just appear on messenger that I am not friends with.
Keeps freezing since last update... Errrrrrr 
Keeps closing...wth??
I love it .I can find one and all
Love it        :)
It's very usefull
Good
To many ads hate messenger almost time to dump it
Its very bad app so slow taking such a long time to get start
Need 4 replying to comments...
Stop forcing me to have two apps to do the job of one app.  What stupid design.
I live all my life on facebook. Better furnish my living place with a better UI. Otherwise super app
Its no working.... Loading, loading, loading
Make a way to delete messages fast
Won't download on my tablet
Rr
Macam haram dajeiiiiiiiii
The most pictures of any thing like posts , profile picture , any pic at wall was dosen't loading . Plz take care about this
Wats really new with this version.. I still having a doubt..
Too slow evem if with at connection
Its the worst
I hate this app. Its only getting 1 star because you can't give 0.
Cool
Maza nahi hai yaar
V.nyc use of fb
Good
Ever since the update its been crashing nonstop
Sucks. Bugs.
I still want the "unfollow post" function to work... but it never has. Please fix it.
They just need to stop putting locations on everything
Please let someone else try their hand at making this app better. Why can't we just view most recent instead of something from 2 days ago?
I'm not sure how to put this but it's very good to a certain extent but if you could keep all these idiots off, it would be the greatest app to all smart phones.
Needs more speed
Slow, buggy, always awake, destroying my battery.
Keeps shutting down on its on repeatedly.
Awesome
Nice
nak jgkkkkkk
Messages worked for a little bit then stopped. Wont use till messages work again and downloaded messanger and still doesnt work.
Excellent
Can't connect to Facebook and candy crush. Bummer
HTC EVO 4g LTE
Auto sync contacts without permission you need to fix it like now. I have disabled it like 100 times. Plz fix or I will only be using the Brower for Facebook. Seems like the app is just more of a pain!!!!!! :(
Nice maka me more friends
But not the best game ever
ok..better
Ok.
Improved a lot. But pls cut his data usage
Love it
This app sucks up too much space on my phone. Then to top it off you can only get half way through a news feed and it jumps to the top. So ready to uninstall.

It freeze up alot
Jose Lopez the
I don't want a separate app to send messages to acquaintances...
Great!
Keeps me in contact with my family and friends!! :-)
Hu
I'd give it 0, but it's not an option.
It would be great if you could have the news feed in order by time and date....instead I go through my news feed and see posts from 2 and 3 days ago. I see postings at top of my news feed from hours ago then next post I see is from minutes ago then the next 3 days ago......and also wvery time I get half way through my news feed and comment on something and after leaving my comment and exit out of whom evers status it takes me back to the top of my news feed instead of picking back up where I leave off.
I used this app and i just love it...
Awesome
Great place to keep in touch with family and friends...
Not bad
Title says it all. Every update gives me less of what I want and more stuff I don't.
Update makes work better
Hi
This app is good but it make my phone two slow
Wonderful
.
This app is so easy to use :)
Update without updating changelog? Wtf?
Bubble
As soon as they convince me that their opinion is mine,  I will submit my opinion
After every update, spends forever "setting up Facebook"
Description...
Slow as hell
This apps takes too much space after some time. Clear data every month is not convenient.
This piece of shit lags on my nexus 5 . fix it please
Much better if you have video call on messenger
Awesome
Good
What the hell why it sync to my contact
It is a very smart aap,to connect with friends and family..l really like
Takes a lot of space!
look great...fast.
Best
These last few updates have been great, the app has really improved in performance.
Seriously, with everything that Facebook can do you would think I would be able to upload a cover photo to an event from my phone.
It suck that we need a different app for conversations
Not bad....
Liked it.
Good application's to you, but it would like the idea of the day of your choice.
Why does Facebook need to synchronize my contacts with my facebook ones? Stupid!:-I
Crashes everytime i scroll through timeline
Takes Forever To Download
GOVIND
good
Not good
Will not stop syncing contacts
This update is a mess....I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it no stars but the developers don't care anyway...
Continuously getting an upload failed message. Even after updating the app.
Good app
Enjoying fb
need improvement for images
As I love fb
Robert
Fb  love
What is new in this ? Everytime you give the same updates !
This app has always worked until I got my samsung galaxy tablet 3 and now this is the only application that will crash when I start using it or try going to my friends wall... #disappointed
Not bad
After the last update it uses a lot of my phone memory
Thats good
Stop syncing with my contacts when you do NOT have my permission and I have to keep changing the option back to don't sync. Very frustrating and ready to un-install!!!
super slow .
Facebook
Hellp
Love the app
Useless
I can't open the app at all
Its very awful when a message comes it turns to messenger, urrrr
Good
Good app
in this 21'st century facebook is must for each & every. one can't live a second also without it so it's a thrill & expression of filling with near & dear
New update auto syncs my contacts. I turn it off and it turns right back on the next time I use the app. Very frustrating. Fix please.
It repeatedly closes itself over and over right after i open it on my galaxy tab 3.  Completely useless app
Very good
V
Beautiful
Couldn't live without facebook
God
I have another facebook I haven't used in years and I tried to deactivate because I use my other facebook it never deletes the page I tried every angle it told me and it keeps telling me to log back in page expired it doesn't make sense at all there making it difficult for you to delete your page smdh
The app can access the texts, calls and pics of those who do not even have the app installed simply by that person being called by someone who does. That's not permission that's THEFT BY AN ACCOMPLICE!!! Facebook can and will turn over your post records, gps location even pictures to government agencies to assist in criminal investigations or allegations. This app started as a social media site but Facebook and Google have had their data contracted and released to government agencies and by accepting terms.
Like
App is too slow!!! App needs bug fixes.
I FREAKING HATE THIS NOW AS I NEED TO INSTALL MESSENGER TO BE ABLE TO CHAT WITH MY FRIENDS AND I WANT A BETTER APP OF THIS ON THE ANDROID YOU B****!(Though I still like the pc one better)

It works.
new smileys
Not very good.
Best update i have that
Always help
Nice
This app has gone downhill fast. I know you are sung and reading these comments plus the emails that we are sending so WHY NOT FIX THIS PIECE OF CRAP APP. Who wants their Facebook contacts to sync with their phone contacts. Even when the sync is disable on Facebook it will go and change the settings to have it automatically sync. If I wanted it synced I would do it myself. Don't need an app to make that decision for me.
Can't load new feed. Fix it
Very very nice app es to kaimzzzzz koi ni ho skdi
good
Jay swaminarayan
Beautiful
4 star before but Latest update have it in 5 star range now
Hate that it autosync contacts without permission even when I disable it. Have to log out of facebook completely in order ro remove contacts.
Crashes everytime I try to view comments or pictures or when I like a posting. Have tried everything with no luck. Facebook should be able to fix this!!!  This happens only on my Samsung tablet.
Vry slow wrked app
Great app
It was a good aap
Not availaBle
How can I put an emosion or smili in my comments
Nice
Makes old phone almost stop working. Msger even worse.
This app can do anything at any time. Uninstalled.

Benjanini
Exelente
Bug filled POS. Too many ads and cannot read messages without installing another app
Stop forcing us to do things the way you want it. Like a separate app for chatting. And invading our privacy. We just want to check our facebook.
It won't open for me
this is awesome and you people need to be nice
I like it but it loads so long to get in
Keeps randomly exiting on my P2
Knowing somebody through fb
I prefer the older version
Facebook is growing better day by day in app. Although CPU Usage is bad , memory usage is nice , you should have game mode that turn off notification syncing for a time to keep the phone running at its best performance. I feel sad that Facebook discard its one-day in-app browser , it is fastest than Chrome! I hope that you will give us all avaliable on any post to sticker comment , it's very addictive to the app.
This facebook app is extremely Slow to open, and it does crash often.....Developer get your head to work
Why did you people take out chat? Now I'm forced to open it on my browser just to chat with friends. I would of given 5 stars but now I'm trying to not use Facebook instead. Decisions like this might not seem like a big deal but they will add up and it won't be good for Facebook a program I use to love to hate Now I'm just starting to hate it.
Totally checking amazing
Close friends option is only showing one post. What the heck happened? Already tried restarting phone and uninstalling/reinstalling fb to see if it would fix the issue but no luck. Seems fb app just keeps getting worse -_-
Nice
Good app. But need an emprovement..very slow respond became hang i cant move the screen...
Since the latest update, the app is force closing more often than not.  This is a problem.
New, best friend of the human 
Need help support at your browser to see if you can help with problem s
Good
Facebook is really useful for this generation
ok
Love it
I honestly can't stand how the Timeline is formatted. It's a timeline. Shouldn't it be ordered by, I dunno, time? And when it updates, why does it send me back to the top automatically? Excuse me, I was reading something! You guys are in such a hurry to fix things that don't need fixing, that you're just creating more small, annoying issues...
I don't give my permission to sync my contacts with Facebook! Messenger sucks and shouldn't have a separate app for it. Fix your bugs! Asap!
Although Facebook contact sync was disabled, after last update contact start to sync automatically.
Best
Where is the stickers in comment for samsung tab 2 ???????!!!! Hate this app !!
-Beuties finest.
Hate the fact that you have to download the messenger app to get the messages on Facebook. Please fix.
Awesome like
SERIOUSLY.... CAN YOU PLEASE JUST FIX IT. ..............

zoosk
When i try to upload a video it alaways ends up crashing. And then it will not let me cancel the upload, or even go on facebook alone. And then the video never uploads. Please fix ASAP
Chat room is not showing. It only shows the recommendation of downloading messager
Bueno
Is retrieving all running applications, is impossible to answer the phone call , massive background process! Taking ages to open, notifications doesn't arrive on time or doesn't arrive at all, I don't understand why the FACEBOOK can't sorted out its essential service !
GARBAGE!! It will nor stay open more than 3 seconds and continues to say it must be "force closed." WTH?!
Awesome
adelice
Nice
Great
Hi all far....
So good
Very Good!!!
On fb
Every time I try to access my photos and look at my albums, it crashes and goes back to home. Please fix this!
My mom uses it my aunt uses it I love my account
It's syncing contacts without permission its annoying my entire fb list is now in my contacts...my sync for FB has always been turned off and app is set to just sync existing contacts but everything else I had off and they show off but this week I noticed since update my FB list in in my contacts unless I remove account which logs me off and if I log on again same thing even though I click don't sync when app starts up...
Best app
This app is great
Facebook started to sync with contacts on my phone, even after changing the settings. It would remove the contacts temporarily, but it would come back up after. It is really annoying. Another problem, the chat area, where it shows who's online and offline, doesn't always show the friend's status, instead shows nothing or a phone icon. The app also performs slower overall. Device: Samsung Galaxy SIII
Always crashes and freezes. Constantly needs to be forced closed. Other than that it is an alright app.
I can't even download the app on my new phone it half downloads then comes up with incompatible update can someone help
Good Good
Pretty annoying as it shuts down every 2 minutes for no apparent reason and if you were in the middle of a post, you have to start again. It's much better to use the web browser than the app.
Kkkk
Its great
Love it
Badass
Every time I start it it just exits without giving me option to report error
Thanks for your help
Issues on Nexus?
Hit
It's good  but most of the time the image not saved
Nothing like it
Total rubbish, doesn't even work properly! Pathetic app...
Good app
Failed to load additional comments, it automatically quit the app.
...But am very annoyed that it restarts after I click and view a web link. Please fix this. It does not do it on my Moto X, but on my LG G Pad.
Keeps rebooting anything I do. It used to be very reliable. What have you done guys?!
It's cool i guess so
It's awesome!
What is the use of making people download something they don't need it just take up space
Nice to one
But not downloading
Good
Very bad update...a lot of slowness
Muhammadsher
it needs improvement
Constantly says Facebook isn't responding....hate the update!
On the best
Don't always need the computer at home to get in Facebook. Lol
Very very Gud
Rameya
Good
Runs like it should, great load time, great app!
Good app but  there is no option video download ...plz.. how can i do..
You don't need to sync all my contacts and get your business all up in my phone. Just give me 1app (not two) to update my status. For crying out loud you don't need so much data on me and access to my information.

Since the latest update the app will close out when checking notifications or viewing photos. No issues on the phone, but on the tablet there has been nothing but issues.
So baddddddd
Excellent app
I can't get into my album's from my Phone!!!! I can open, then it shuts back down right away!! This is getting WAY OLD!!!! PLEASE STOP MESSING WITH OUR LAYOUTS!!!! IT'S GETTING OLD!! IF I want it changed,  I should be the one to change it!!! NOT you!!!!

How about an update? Every time I open it up and I hit a auto play video it freezes and shuts down. Samsung note 2.
Why do i have to be forced to use messenger that blows

When I try to open links in both Chrome anf Firefox they crash. Sometimes it just opens the associated app and not the actual link. This only happens if I open them through Facebook.

We should not be made to download a massaging app just to message people when we can do it on the actual facebook app already

The app crashes before even showing the homepage, has been so for a very long time. I hope this changes soon. Device is Cubot X6
I don't like fb to see my private stuff
Even though I completely exit the app it still runs in the background and I have to go to the task manager to shut it down. Ugghh they fix one thing but screw up another.

I hate that you have to install the messenger app if you want to see your messages in the fb app I understand that the messenger app has more features but the terms and conditions of downloading the messenger app is unacceptable!!!!! :-) I will no longer be using the fb app ..I'll be doing all my facebooking through chrome!!!!! :-)
Facebook is amazing
Why is not opening face book
It does the job, still better off signing in on your browser tho
Very useful lovely thanks

During the first minute of using it, it runs fine but after a while it crashes. This always happens every time I use this.
Its still not letting me up load videos. Everytime i want to uload a video i have to un install the update just to post. Fix now please and i will rate higher

Every time I open my Facebook app it's on camera roll like I'm trying to upload a photo?  I back out of it to my news feed every time but somehow it is always the first thing I see when opening the app. Will give 5 stars when a bug fix update is available for galaxy note 2. Thanks

I love it I can irrate my cuzies and get cool friends there it is great no improvments needed its just perfect!!
I like the app and how streamlined it is. However i hate to upload pictures through it because the only filing system it allows is this idiotic camera roll. Not all pictures i care to access are in chronological order.  It makes it feel as if I'm searching for a needle in a haystack.

I found the main problem with this app is it's stored in internal memory only. And, there is no option available to move this app to phone/SD. The size it's take also higher comparatively other app.

Not bad

Can't describe in few lines..

Made the mistake of downloading the new update on my android. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. I have to constantly select most recent stories. I don't care what people posted last week. I want to see what they posted TODAY, in the order they posted it. Also, app doesn't show everything my friends are posting either.
Very easy to lk at images
I will no longer use this worthless app on my phone. I demand my privacy!!
Sign up and login are extremely cumbersome and complicated. The app needs a complete makeover until I can give a thumbs up on it being intuitive.

Constantly crashing or fails to load full stop. If this continues I will take off my phone!!! Sony expire u
Way too much unwashed privacy invasion for a service that invades my privacy too much as is.
whenever i log in using this app it says that we have forwarded ur messages to the messenger nd to install messenger bt i don't wan't to use messanger  nd it doesn't opens my messages..it is forcing me to use messenger.
Last time Facebook doesn't require Facebook Messenger to message people via Facebook. Now Facebook require Facebook Messenger for messaging via Facebook.
I've been having this issue for so long now. I just don't wanna complain or something because FB is FREE. But it's getting a little irritating now really. Why does FB keep on saying 'network problem or something' i keep on getting this error message but when I try to use google or use instagram, my internet is fine! I also log on to my FB using my browser and it works just fine. Tried uninstalling already. So I guess the problem is with the FACEBOOK APP itself. Hope you read this and fix the problem!
I am not able to stop Facebook app running in background. Even if I select force close, after few minutes I can see that the app is still running.
To much process when open ---> end with error
It is not good app cover very high memory

After this last update the app keeps changing the settings I've set inplace.  Fir example.  I don't sync any contacts with facebook but everyday I find facebook friends in my contacts and I have to go to the app and RECHECK the option to not sync!  Very frustrating and I am at the point of uninstalling the app completely!
So stupid how you FORCE everyone to download the Messenger, why not give people options to do what ever they want? Also Facebook is changing my settings from what I set it to.
amazing
App keeps crashing anytime i try to update my status or comment on something... please fix or i wont use it anymore
They ask for to many permissions on the app and invades your privacy. To many bugs and crashes. Messenger is a bad deal. Read the permissions before you click install.

Facebook doing good job but I have one doubt. Why we are searching another software for Facebook video downloading??? If you can doing everything this world waiting for download option
Personally i think the next new update should allow u to save videos to a device.

I preferred it when I could access the notifications while I was reading most recent. Now when you go to anything other than TOP you lose access to the tabs. Also pictures take forever to load and sometimes don't. It is the app, not the net. Facebook mobile doesn't have this problem.
My Facebook is not working good :(

I found there is a setting to stop links opening in the FB browser, so I have increased ratong. I can no longer get rid of adverts or as I call them spam posts and obviously get rid of messenger. I refuse point blank to install such bloatware. It's getting to the stage where I'm considering leaving Facebook.
I loved it but you should put some more graphic or make it look good inside.                          I think you will do that so am giving you 5star's. Thank you
Very nic
Updates no good keeps crashing can't play sum uploads

A good application no words to say for previous version. New version is not good picture etc i.e. news feed  didn't come or take too much time . Therfore l reduced 5 star to 3 star .

What can i say what everybody doesnt already know. Facebook is the best thing to ever be introduced to mobile phones, just makes keeping in touch all that much easier!!! The app is fast and doesnt ever stall!!
If I select a story that opens the browser it opens chrome but doesn't seem to even try opening a specific page.
Bt some time it not woking

New updates suck and will not install separate app just for messenger! I can't share posts!
Not good service
The newest version will randomly just close doesnt even give me a force quit option i like tge older version better i have an lg spirit 4g

"the official facebook app", it has made me rate it with a single star again after the last update it doesnt close on its own even after pressing the back  button you have to go to the task manager to close the app and consumes your RAM and BATTERY very rapidly......really again facebook official app has disappointed me.....why can't they look for the flaws properly and release a stable version
Oy billet

New app update keeps syncing my phone contacts with Facebook contacts even though I don't want it to. In addition, can't see nearby friends since the last update. Don't know what's going on there.
Ok
Can't upload photo
I have delete the app because I have to unsync contacts every 20 minutes! I am not sure if it is from an update but it needs to be fixed! If I wanted everyone's information in my phone I would choose the option.
Nice app

Why, on my Galaxy S3 does it keep saying Facebook Login Expired. Log in again.? I never have to log in again to get access. It's annoying.
Nice app
It's good to me that I can see the full range of people who are looking for a few of the best in your life with our friends
Hate..

Fast...though you can't delete your posts.
Videos only half load, before they completely freeze. Messages are coming late. . . .
Facebook filters most posts from friends that wish to see them. Very few of my posts reach any of my friends and family. Facebook has deemed my posts as unimportant

Love it and give them a 5*
i love this facebook app!
This is no 1 app
They are basically making you give up all your information on your phone, in order to be able to text your friends through facebook. They do this by continuously asking you if you would like to download facebook messenger. When you download facebook messenger it has acces to basicaly your whole phone. 
What the hell?! It always says "Low on space" even if I still have a lot of space. It also consumes a lot of MB. Plus it force closes and does'nt load, and finishes its set ups. Please fix this problem ASAP. This is a stupid update that you made.
Ok
It is a great app hands down.
Every time i comment on a post its hung why?even when i send messages too!!
Need a lot improve
I like this app. It is entartaining! ^^
Good app but its so slow.
Excitin
I love u
Super
More update more update
Could use an option to set news feed to most recent. Annoying to make this step every time opening the app. Also, most recent should contain what's most recently posted, not most recent comments on old posts also.
Pretty Nice......
welcome to facebook this facebook good for every body ok a you jeyles
Pictures won't load
22222
TO MUCH USAGE OF CPU
Not bad but it is not showing chat list properly even person is not in fb showing in chat list
New update keeps syncing my fb friends contact information in my contacts on my phone, I keep disabling it and it takes it off it self it's becoming annoying so i am deleting the app until it have it's bug fixes
Id give five stars if I were able to use emojis in comments & status'. You can only use emojis in messenger & it sucks. I have an android phone so I dont have emojis..& this app drains my battery very very quickly. Please fix this.
Drinks network and memory and delivers everything offline
Very useful
The new update SUCKS every time I turn off contact sync it always finds a way to turn itself back on. Uninstalling until this is fixed!!!
To slow
Loving it.
Huv
I dont know why but now the app cant be accesed by its regular icon. I have to use it from another app because it crashes everytime i open it.
Keep up the good updates
Superb
yaar abhi bhi comments dekhoge
Its good and fast
Make provision in Facebook to download or transfer its videos into mobiles or into memory card easily and also there should be separate section for videos in personal account of a person in Facebook.  Thanks
Subbu
Force close ? Always. 
Muito bom
Keka
Very nice

Very cool application !
So I just updated this app and still can't watch videos!! Should've never updated before this time had no problems BIG MISTAKE!!! If I could give you no stars sure as hell wouldn't being you don't deserve any stars!! Please fix the problem and stop updating "IF IT'S NOT BROKE LEAVE IT ALONE!!" Whomever claims to be a programmer NEWS FLASH you aren't and should be fired!!! Smdh
Awesome
General
My old id is not opening....... In this fb
Love keep in touch with family he% e
Wen ever i try to play a video the application closes. Plzz try to solve dis problem
It keeps saying cannot play video at this time
Whenever I'm gonna use my facebook, the loading too much long. It's says "setting up the facebook" and "just a moment" can you please update the facebook again? And remove those with 2 quotes above it. And keep this facebook loading fast like 5 or 10 seconds. I hope you read and understand my reply. Thanks
Uuuu

Linkage app at anything! Friends, acquaintances, haters "no flex zone", work, family and the world..... Just be careful you post crap that should stay in your thoughts.
Needs a few more options that the full site has. Specifically the 'hide from page' option for photos etc.
Constantly crashes...like 5-10 minutes after I open the app and it happens every single time. I have even tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it didnt fix the issue.
I love it
I hate seeing the same posts from days ago everyday. The app freezes with every new update and has to be rebooted before I can use my phone for anything else. The widget doesn't work anymore.
fun
STOP SYNCING MY CONTACTS TO MY PHONE I'M NOT INTERESTED!!!
Since the update, the app has crashed more than before. Please fix it. Or if it's just my phone, tell me how to fix it. I gave tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and that didn't work.
Good after none friend

Not a smooth experience for me, have been using higher end phones and compared to other applications this feels memory hungry and sluggish while scrolling/moving. Please try improving your interface.

Facebook
There is No option to post photos or videos directly to groups from a mobile device. It is ridiculous that I have to get on a computer to post directly to my groups. The only way I can get it to work is to post it to my timeline and then when I click share I have the option to post it to a group.  I don't necessarily want it on my timeline and then when I delete it from my timeline it deletes the share to the group. Please fix this ASAP.
Uninstalling
All can tother in Facebook

Ang galing talaga nang facebook

I hate that a "like" or "comment" on a random post or pic on other people's pages, show up in random friends feeds. This gives you zero privacy. It's made me much less active than I used to be.
Best ...
Only thing that annoys me about the facebook app is my other apps don't automatically open facebook links thru this app. Rather they try to load thru my browser.  Update: It's also is a total battery hog on the newest version. This app eats up even more battery than my display or any other app I have running on a daily basis. Updated update: Now it just won't update my news feed or anyother displayed content. I uninstalled and attempted to reinstall but it won't reinstall.
This app is good but we need separate app to send msg

It keeps crashing. It never did it before, why now?
is incapable to make a decent app that is without glitches... Mindboggling!
Each successive update seems to slow this app right down, to the point that I am resorting to the web browser!
Good but not upto the mark Chalega typessss

No better way to keep intouch.Keep them as close or as far away as you like
Annoying how you will get a notification that someone has replied to a comment, but it doesn't show up as a reply like on the PC version. Other than that it's good.
Too much intrusion
Itz cool
Its work well in my phone. But, please add some video chat.
I do not want my Facebook friends syncing with my phone contacts. Every time I change it in my settings (both Facebook and phone), Facebook still syncs up. So annoying. I want to keep them separate! This never used to be a problem until now.
Amazing
It used to be easier to navigate to friends and to delete some things. I like it because I can keep it private

Takes too much space and needs internet at high speed. So I feel it's better to check fb on web itself. And now no messages also. Why the heck should I install a separate app for fb messages? Utter non sense.
Just blank most if the time.
I do not like the latest version of Facebook. After the latest update Facebook now syncs my contacts with the contact app automatically without permission even if the settings says don't sync. Please Facebook make amends to fixing this.
Awesome app np... Its little bit slow on 2G netwrk... On 3G u users can gusses speed :P
It is good apps
Woo
My Facebook wasn't working properly, so I unistalled it and tried to reinstall.....now I cant even do that because when I try to download it, all I get is an "error 919" message.
wont load the searchs and profiles..  and sync contacts everytime, with the option disable..
Satisfied with app just annoying having to keep signing in
4toz error some time...plz do thz
Good
Great apps
The only thing I don't like about Facebook it's that we have to have the Facebook messenger
Why Don't Downlaod videos from Facebook?Can u make Facebook downlaod video same 1.5.0.0.0
this is a 3 class...fb apss.. in world.
It's pointless. I can't check my notifications anymore. Where the hell do i find my profile? I would give it no stars but you gotta have it just to review it.

Since the update it crashes and freezes a lot. Not my phone as several friends with different phones and providers have the same issue, way to mess it up fb... Since then they have done another update and the issue is worse than before... Horrible, i am actually considering going back to Myspace

Iloveit
Please make folder like gallery when choosing any photo to upload..hard for me to scroll down to search for a photo.. hope can fix it..
Just stop trying to fix things. I miss being able to decide if I want recent or top stories on my news feed. Now I see the same 20 stories all week. Can't even turn off notifications for a comment thread without going to the site. You're a long way from 5 stars.
this is a very good version n very fast i like it.
Ok
Deddie827gmailcombeddie121234
Newsfeed get repeated often, comments get delayed on posting. Typical Facebook stuff. It works though, I guess.
This update was worse then the last takes 10 mins to load closes out all the time, im so sick of seeing, "just a moment" and it doesnt even load!!! Fix this app
mcm kure2
It uses up half of my ram. You need to make it smaller in size. Facebook messenger is fine, but this app is constantly getting on my nerves. I can't even see emojis! I put when I share photos but on a non mobile device I can. I'm using mobile for a reason so I can use Facebook better. Please fix the size of it, it's destructive to my phone's ram.
Good but very slow in staring m y id
Giiiii
i hate it evertime facebook crashes.. its getting into my nerves..and im really disappointed about that thing.

Hey,  it takes too long to load, this didn't happen with the other versions so am kinda unhappy now, and sometimes it just doesn't load!
The app has kind of been getting worse and worse ever since the messenger app had to be down my facebook takes for ever to load and after 5 minutes it says its not responding.
Problems, problems, problems!!!!!!! I'm over this app.

I just don't like how it keeps syncing fb contacts to my actual phone contacts, its a bit annoying.
Maja aa gaya
I love the app! It just keep getting better. So far I've had no problems.
So, now the app goes to the little blue Facebook loading screen, has the little loading circle, then exits out to my home menu. So it no longer works right...or at all for that matter.
Photos & other events r easily viewed. Ease of information and much more
Nice
Its great facebook even faster
Awesome app

Its cool cos I can make contacts with our family and friends who are far from us
Good..I like so much
Super
bloody my hell for this app....... It is nt opening
This app can control your phone.
Every time I try to login  Facebook either say's that have incorrectly entered the wrong password or the E Mail is not correct please try again. F- -K that I'm done with your browser servers, ect. Roger Hines

It consumes too much storage.
This,is the only place I've to go to find anyone who will talk to me.
I HATE that you have to download the messenger app it is making my phone slow and facebook crash!!!!
Best and super aap
Is not responding well

Good app but doesn't give the option for "most recent" stories on the timeline for droid users.
App keeps crashing everytime i click on something.  Have uninstalled numerous times. Please fix
News feed wont load, so..... What's the point?
Love it
Everytime I opened it since I updated it, it opens very slow and stating "Setting up facebook" then after that "Just a moment". It takes for almost five minutes to open my fb app. Sometimes its not responding. I love fb, I like to give five star but I didnt enjoy it recently due to some logs and everytime I open but meesenger thru fb, if the message pop up, my fb timeline will close suddenly. But its still the best app.
I love the app
Go to open app just grey screen then closes itself.
Hiii
screen keeps going dark and it wont let me post
Your last up date sucks it keeps freezing and shuting down don't want the messenger app I'm about to delete your bs until you fix it now it won't let news feed load are you fu*** kidding me

Would be better if we could move it to an SD card so it wasn't taking up so much space on ur phone. that and it just closes like it has an issue for no reason
Sahadev
Used full
nice
Good morning
But I think it needs bit improvement in terms of privacy
Just dont waste your time on this stupid app. I understand why you need access to SMS, Phone, Photos/Media/Files, Camera, and Wi-Fi connection but all the other stuff that you're asking for access to is ridiculous. There is absolutely NO reason for this app to have so much access to so much stuff that it really Does NOT Need! Then they make this other app, Messenger, that you must download to view your facebook messages and even that app is a piece of crap, just another scam by Facebook. This is ridiculous!
I've never had too much of a problem with this app until recently. Even though I keep changing my settings, facebook keeps syncing my contacts. It makes my texts lag and messes up my contacts. This is a new issue for me - please fix ASAP!
Yep I like it LOL
Error watching videos
Ok
I feel like I have to un-sync my contacts almost every time I log into my Facebook account. Please make it stop.
I own a galaxy tab 3 10.1 but when I got the kit kat update the app just crashes everytime I open it, I hope it gets fixed soon because this was the app I would always use
Testing my tempo...
It is lovely app we can send messages,share images and thoughts and sens any music or recorded sound by this app.
Most of the time I open the app, it closes on me. And facebook won't do anything about it so I don't use it anymore.
Good
I very like this app work it
It's very nice app, But it's getting heavy battery consumption for loading & using, This app is ot having privacy, Automatically syncing all of my contacts including unwanted contacts and also It's chat options used only via messenger so it's waste.
I like it
Why does facebook keep crashing everytime I try and use it? It legit cant handle more than 15 seconds without crashing. It use to be a good app but now its just a waste of space.
90% of the time I click on something the whole app closes out! Hate going on facebook because of this recent issue. ..
Takes a lot of your storage...
Loved it
No way am I updating. Facebook does not need to read my sms mms and basicly my whole phone.
God
Doesn't stay logged in, continuously kicks me off when I try to post or comment. Fix this please
I have RAM sized 512mb, and I can't playing some game.. I have two options, keep installing "fb" but I can't play that game or uninstall "fb" so I can play that game. I have my own solution, uninstall "fb" when I wanna playing the game, then install it again when I feel bored with the game, I should do that over and over again.. It's suck.
You guys should give androids the option to watch videos in HD cause the quality isn't that great.
Crashes a lot
Not able to copy d posts like in d Web version and the latest patch is crashing like anything
News feed messed up, displays old stories. Keeps freezing and shutting down!  Won't let me post status!!  LEAVE IT ALONE ALREADY!!

Nice
Great app
My husband and I, we have the same phone and service! He have the new setting on his app Lockscreen Notification On Off so he gets to see his notification on his locked screen but I can't my Facebook app does not have the option on the settings to where I can turn on or off! I deleted and reinstall the app twice and nothing! So stupid ugh

Facebook finally Did good updates!! No complains!
Very nice app
Fine

I met alot of kool friends on this
Very good
Will no longer use facebook mobile. There is no reason for an app to override my choice to have it not sync contacts. Big mistake facebook.  I dont want 400 people I barely talk to in my phone contacts. Very poor design/functionality.
I really don't to rate my self. I thank it best for someone  else to  do that.
Keeps logging me out!!!
Keeps syncing contacts even though I keep turning the setting off. VERY frustrating!!
Download error.
Much improved over prior versions.  Still don't like Top Stories. You don't know what I think is important. Also, I'll decide which posts from pages I want to see. Please stop filtering them. Put messaging back in the regular app. I'm not downloading another app for no reason. It's inefficient and a waste if memory. Fix the news feed errors, too.
Facebook is nice application but not faster than messager
love
Hi i am using redmi 1s in this phone facebook app frequently  crash when i trying  to log in plz fix this issue.
Its very nice
This app made very slow my phone, also always when I open Faceboo, it close. ;l

bad app

Very good
Anytime you open facebook on a Samsung tablet it just auto closes you cannot even scroll down you cannot look at any pictures you can't do anything without it auto closing
Its OK but always stops working
Ok
Good
Newer updates are worse yet!!!! OMG!! CAN IT BE ANY SLOWER!!!  Fb has stopped once again and froze my phone so i cant report it!!! Stop w the crappy new stuff and really bring it up to standard. I use a galaxy phone and updates on fb  are constantly causing problems on my phone. I keep reporting but it continues.
book a day together.
Can't copy and paste text, can't edit our comments on someone else's posts, and at certain times can't share a post to someone else's timeline or in a msg
i like facebook cause people be puting up funny vidoes

ye tk hai per sb publicity hota hai.
The app was fine for me until my last update. Now it wont let me like anything at all! Some updates say they posted but never do. Was forced to download messenger to view my messages, but no matter what phone i use whenever i have both installed on my phone facebook blacks out and my phone freezes. Uninstalled and will stick to using the chrome browser to do anything facebook from now on.
facebook is facebook. the app works fine, but now it syncs with my existing contacts by itself. Then if i change it to not sync, IT CHANGES ITSELF BACK!!!!! FIX THIS PLEASE!
Drama
Nice
Not bad
But plz add a video call option then it will be became a perfect app....*****(5) stars
Ok but instagram is better wish we can view our timeline in order
Keep on updating and it sucks. Why? It took a lot of memory in my phone and I can't enjoy this app. It made me just mad. Tsk!
Faster facebook,
Slowly.
I like the app, but think it's stupid that you have to download the messenger just to be able to read mail..it gets a lower rating just for trying too make everyone download a pointless app.
Any doubt its perfect as usual
Yadav
It was better when u first started. Sometimes u need to leave well enough alone. 10/12 it keeps synching phone numbers to my phone even after I change it.
Very useful
App keeps closing when trying to comment on posts or photos.

Is fine
The CEO promised that our privacy would not be compromised. Sad to see how money and government influence has made a 90 degree turn of what fB was set out to be.  We are now being made to use Messenger.  Choice of the friends is no longer the goal.
I love texting my friends but freeze alot
Nice
Facebook has worked hard to get this app up to snuff. Stable and very useful.
Is this average
Great way to connect with long lost friends and family.

Too many error messages when strolling down my need feed...

It's log me out. It has some issue. needs to be fixed
All that and more!

Has been doing much better.. However I just had to uninstall then reinstall just to get it to work because it froze up. Might have a big or two in the new update..?
Closes for no reason

Not bad
The app settings will not stay where I set them. I do NOT want Facebook to sync with my contacts, but I have to change it back to that preference every hour. Horrible.
Use it every day but It takes to long to load

Come on people fix the problems
Although the app is nice it always is telling me that I should confirm that this is really my account. Please answer back y it does this ASAP. Thank u.
A recent update has caused the app to keep syncing my contacts. I turn off sync and it just turns itself back on a short while later. I won't be using Facebook until this is resolved, it's incredibly frustrating!
Bauteful  F
I have spent too many hours on this app when I should be doing other, more productive activities. A big ol' waste of time on the go. And my phone won't remove it completely. This makes me livid.

Would be 5 star if we had an option to have "most recent" news feed like the site.
Good to keep up with friends and family
How do they think they know wwhat my top stories are
This app really sucks!! Since the update the app keeps syncing my facebook contacts to my phone contact...I don't need all those people on my contact list...fix this ASAP
Needs custom privacy status option.
Meh ...
It's bad enough that the messenger is not in the regular facebook app but now, it keeps wanting to sync my contacts with my contacts in my phonebook when I keep changing it back. The same reason why I won't get messenger is the same reason I will delete this app. You don't control my how I do things FB.
I love it that now I don't need to be looking on my moms phone. Thank you the people that created Facebook . You guys are awesome
Usefull
Sick of all the crap with messaging, how many apps do I need from
10/12: App still randomly shuts down. I'm done with the app and will use the mobile site.

The Facebook app on iOS is so much faster,  more simple and attractive. Why do we get stuck ,with a slow ugly complicated version? And for the love of god just get rid of the "top stories" garbage. NOBODY USES IT. IM TIRED OF HAVING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A SEPARATE TAB TO SEE MY ACTUAL NEWS FEED. Comments and likes delete themselves
Before this new update it was working great..BT after this phone starts to hang when ever I open it..I think Dis new update is just wasting your internet....
Nice
Really needed this app
Thought my mobile was problem and got another one. Its still not letting me to log in for 2mobths now jst trying to log on...but not succes there
Facebook
Omg just got on and its amazing 
I want to open the app and see my news feed the way I want to see it. I don't want to have slide all the way to the more tab and tap most recent every single time.
It will not work it goes to a blue Facebook screen and says loading..it then proceeds to stop and go back to the phone home screen

It great lol
good app but have some problems .. some time connection filed with 4G connection message appear and connection ok and some times cannot sing-out if problem get,take a lot of ram system and this casus to device slow and app it-self slow
Keeps force closing. Having more problems every time I get an update. Smh guess it's time to delete my social networking profile. Since apparently it's not meant for me to use. * After reading others notes, deleted. This & the messenger. I'm logging into the Web to delete my profile. Pls me know once it gets better. *
It can look through your whole phone or computer

100%
Love some Facebook
Can't show me the post
Despite being disable, it is turned back on after every restart of the phone.
Takes me out of the app everytime i click on something
This app is really good because u can keep updated with your friends with only a press of a button 
I am ms facebook 411..anything ya wana know i have already posted.lol
I will get notifications for things i don't want but cannot get notifications for things i want to. There's not a notification button for pages you like anymore. And i miss the lists you could put people on for mobile. Like close friends, games, aquantainces, restrict. And over half the time I can't get to my saved links list. Even when I have good internet
It is mostly the same thing but as u going to the internet it is better I can't say it is horrible and. I cant say it is amazing it is in the middle I do use it alot though
I CANNOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP, IT KEEPS ON SAYING ERROR blabla, pls fix this -___-
I personally like it

Having issues connecting, then once connected goes to my last pic shared instead of news feed, vids don't load correctly or stops then starts or not at all. All started after last update. Needs fixing!
How fit it...
Rubbish app
This is so cool cuz we're doing today and hang out
Not good for mental health
Realy good thing.
It's okay just that it stops every time I scroll

U guys shouldn't get this because it sucks

Removed messaging to a separate intrusive app and updates 20mb every other day. Fail.
Luv it so cool
Ok Its Good
Neat
Why in the Hell is my fb friends contact info synchronized with my phonebook...This crap is really irritating me
It starts services in the background which use ram and cpu time. I realized my phone was getting really slow and got faster for a short while after I kill the facebook service (until it restarted). (also ate the battery)  I couldnt stop facebook from running the service. Which is dumb because I disabled notifications and location etc. so I have no idea what it did in the background. Perhaps feed secret info to facebook or NSA?  Since I removed the facebook app, my phone is working much better and it is much
Very Good
what are you doing?
Ncy
Facebook is a very good application.it is also very helpful,and is constantly doing better.
It wont even show all the post on people wall or my wall.
I love to go on Facebook but it takes forever to download
Love it!!!
Can't open. Update sucks
But sometimes like d'nt works :/
Love it
Facebook
Good not bad
display is very poor
I do not care for this app, but my phone seems to want it on here. However, I refuse to install messenger and instead go into the browser for messaging. I am on here to keep in touch w/ people, not for marketing.purposes.
Nice
Good for games...huhuhuhu
Initially the photos and videos are loding properly but after browsing for sometime the images and videos are not loading. Please fix this. I have good browsing speed.
WTF is that , no new features add but every time update ?? I hate it
To many problems can't play games. Freezing  , stopping, all kinds of stuff happening I deleted waited days to come back and the same things still going on not happy at all.
I want the version before this one back!!!!!!!!!!! 
Great
When I looked at my chat list it's says people are online then when I.message them then look bk at the chat it says there off line for 9 mins ago really need to sort this out
I can't even stay on it for 3 seconds because it has problems
It's gotten worse since the last update. Crashing at least twice for every hour that I use it.  Comments have to be posted sometimes 3 times before they actually show up. And the speed that was supposed to be added with the latest update has yet to be seen by me. Please fix.
The way this app works is wrong, I'm completely deleting facebook. Basicelly if you download. It gets access to everything, logs passwords, internet use, contacts. Camera you name it. There's an app getting big, then there's a app that can be used as say BIG BROTHER!
Its ok
Very annoying! Please stop sync contact and too long for update! POOR APK'S !!!
Crashes all the time.hating it
Pretty good app but takes a hell lot of space
Great
Nothing to say
Does not load up from start needs fixing
So annoying!!
It works@!!!!!!!@#$$#@!$%+#!
Sanjay Das
App
Thanks!!! Works really good as it should.
Not perfect but helpful
Like
I can use facebook by browser in my phone and then I can do much more things.
Please stop forcing my contacts to sync with Facebook. I am using a Samsung Galaxy S3 (Sprint). I uncheck it and I don't know why it sneakily syncs back. I DO NOT WANT MY CONTACTS SYNCED! Understand that FACEBOOK.
Man
It keeps kicking me out of app and doesnt allow me to browse older posts in my groups
Super
Stays in tune with friends & family
Moving between msgs , notifications , or what so ever is not smooth at all , and blank screen keeps showin , also I can't turn off notifications from posts anymore ! The option is not workin
Social site.
tooo knowledge
Nice
What, happening
Since the last update, it crashes constantly, and will only work when connected to wifi. Please fix this!!!!!
If only it didn't crash so much. PLEASE fix the bugs so it runs more smoothly.
I've been using facebook for long time and I really like it.
Since last update, I'm continually kicked out of app. If it continues, will just uninstall! Fix it!
Love this app
The apps works properly on my Htc Evo but not on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.  It shuts down on any interaction.  I cannot post.  Facebook is all about posting, right?  Wish I could rate it zero stars.
The Greta Paras
Constantly asking for me to "tap to retry" "news feed cannot load" headmelt
It keeps logging me out
Install my Facebook
Love this app but why the constant need of downloading messenger I don't want messenger! I don't like messenger! If it diddnt say I needed messenger to go into my messages it would be 5 star.
I'm getting real tired of your crap Facebook! I can't even make a status anymore!
This update is awful crashes scrolling posts or trying to post a status and editing existing info. Goes to just facebook window and is blank have to force as a task to get out of it. Random times sometime ok for 2 minutes other times 10 seconds. Is it not meant for a tablet?
Dont like it

Suooper
i like it this veresin
there was no problems with the way chat worked before and now I've had to delete a few games because I had an extra app that I shouldn't even need, please fix so I don't need to Facebook apps. And plus when you say that it is easier to switch back and forth from both apps it really isn't, when Im on the Facebook app and I go to the chat bar and click a person to talk to it freezes please fix
Everybody loves facebook right? ;)
Learn to more
Okkk..
It is like a king
User friendly
Good
No words to say stay connected with whole world.
I go to log in & a thing pops up saying, "Sorry. An expected error occurred. Try again later." Really?! Can this be fixed immediately?!
Its working now it ok but a bit boring xxxx
evarooy
It is the baddest app ever.
Gets the job done but heaven forbid you need to do anything group/enent done really sucks in that department.
mannansk
It won't show some pictures this should be fixed
I love the app but it's bull we have to download another app to send messages meanwhile signing out privacy away! I don't need Facebook to do things my phone can already do. Will not download a the Facebook messager app.
good
its very horrible to connect. older version is far far better than this. try to do something to get access.
Ricky
Keeps crashing, literally can't do ANYTHING! Can't comment, can't open links, can't navigate to other people's pages. Hate it! Tried forcing stop, tried uninstalling and reinstalling it...
I love the app
Lover of this so so

Clean And Quick
I have been having issues on two different phones- my old phone was a Galaxy S4 and I recently upgraded to the S5. I have been having issues with the app freezing and when I finally am able to exit it just opens itself again and is still frozen. Today it won't load my whole newsfeed only one status update. The only way to get the app to unfreeze is to restart my phone and it happens 3 or 4 times a day. It is getting ridiculous.
Facebook
It keeps closing for no reason now won't let me update
Very fast
Keeps randomly shutting down as I scroll through my news feed. Very annoying
Very good app but after somtime hangout.
I have an older android and it freezes a lot and my notifications are always nuts lol but I luv facebook
4starts
Facebook
Since update keeps saying no wifi when i try to to my timeline only reason I keep it is for some games cant access timeline
Its deadly

Facebook app is getting heavier and heavier with every update and with every new update it just seem to get more complex and useless. Crash bug is killing!!
Good app
Facebook is more fun,lovely and explending more interesting.
Ok app
Nice

Could use more colour
I hate this app my feeds are to small and I hate everything about this app and it wont let me uninstall it

This is very nice and faster aap
Quick and easy
Everything I open it it closes if yall niggas don't fix it I'm having everyone I know uninstall it

It wont let me download this app on my galaxy note 3 .... not happy
Nothing special
Needs speed.sucks memory.
Used the app but for some reason I can't receive friend requests it worked on my other tablets but my new one can't not sure if it the tablet or the new update...
getting a force close every ten to 20 minutes. And I hate how it won't organize pictures by folder, it just shows everything and u have to spend ten minutes looking for a picture
Awesome
Love it

Trying to force you to use their services. I've only got facebook still till I get all my friends numbers. After the update it still sucks.

Good experience
Samsung Galaxy s5 - got the last update for the FB app and now it won't even start. It pops up the blue FB starting page and then shuts down. Still a PoS app. Has been since I first rated it in 2012...
Its good but video call through this is not so well
What's going on with this app?? 1) this app exit by it self. 2) this app showing error loading news feed. 3) this app force to download messengers.  What did u do as a developer? ? Just sit and see everybody comments and hate this app?? Dont just force somebody to use the app they don't want it. U should do this app better and more easy to use it. Good job for make people hated with your app
Normal
This app sucks..!!
Copy option is not available. .. it is very most disadvantage of this app
Just mind blowing
Hit
sooooo slowly and stuck. why? no fast respon.

Good
Lately I can't even play videos on pages or the ones that my friends share
Ever since the last last update every time I go on it takes forever to load up. Normally it would just go straight inif you're logged in already

Fucken up
Absolute Rubbish App!!!  Spend majority of the time trying to access my account,constantly confronted with : this app is unresponsive .....Force Close/Wait/Report. ..  Finally access my account & itl jst close! & the process of trying to access acc starts Again&Again & so on.    Why dose it FB & Messenger need updating so often?? Arnt the updates meant to improve the service.....makes all of the above Worse!!!    Bout Time these continual problems were sorted out, instead of Stealing ppls Data!!!
Classic.
Cool and fastet
This app was great until my recent update. Now my phone runs slow, the app is always shutting down, my news feed is always out of order. If I had a PC I wouldn't have this app on my cell. And the FB messenger sucks just as bad.
Can't reply to comments, can't copy and paste pictures in comments, can't mark notifications as read without clicking each one individually, requires a separate app for private messages, iPhone's version has more features - such as the ability to reply to comments (and I hate Apple). Basically this app is in major need of an overhaul, or at the very least, a large update.

All thing are good
After the last updated i tried to change my cover but i didn't work the screen freeze why?
Always have issues uploading videos!
Since the last update I only see the same few, very old stories on my wall!!! I am not seeing 90% of what I subscribed to either! I click Recent and I see everything I'm missing but it doesn't default to recent feeds and keeps going back to Top Stories...which shows me crap from a week ago and almost nothing new!

I refuse to accept the requirements for access to my phone's data. Therefore, I will refuse to update. Remove the requirements And I'll not only increase my star rating but also will update. Also, go back to having messenger be separate and equal app, don't force us to download an app we may not want.
Almost got in trouble
Reply function pretty decent now
Nasty
Though it shows 19 MB as size, it's occupying 70 MB and refusing to even login. I have uninstalled it to save my phone memory.
Great
make it smooth just like Google+
Facebook.
Keeps syncing contacts even though I turn that feature off.
Not bad
Will not up load

I don't want FB messenger for the few messages a month I send. I have to reinstall the FB app every time I want to send a message. ridiculous!!!!

Wow superb,,,, I loved fb,,, it's wonderful app,,,,, I shall giving you.............unlimited stars ....
When log out, an error occured. After many times trying to log out, it notice session expired.
I relly like it
Needs more features like group settings and other missing feature's. Requires way too many permissions to trust. Serious privacy concerns, I Highly recommended blocking some of then using App Ops. And messenger is laggy.
5 stars only if this is solved. Everytime i change my profile picture from already used pictures. It is cropped un necessorily . Which is annoying.
Its the only social site that has bugs & needs  to make it easier for cellphone users.
Won't load posted pictures and links.....

I am not able to like any more updates after the update please fix
It's mine
Very nice
Ajeet singh
Facebook's app is definitely worth downloading if you have an Android device and Facebook. The interface is pretty clean and you can do just about everything you need to without your computer. My only gripe is that you can't (to my knowledge) create custom sharing lists for your posts.
what happen? you can answer. please give login open. l sad no happy. you are very good. please help me

I think it is ok. It   is really helpful it u want to post a pic. So stop being rule to the people that made this. At least they tryed to make something! I do  not see that u guys made anything! But anyway awesome app:)
U dont know  guys ........how i am loving........................................nino tamuna

Was working fine till last update. Now takes anything from 2 to 5 mins to open, thats when it does open, 70% of the time i get a message stating facebook has finished or nothing happens and tablet switches back to my app pages. I want to know will it help if i uninstall and install it again
i can't log out what i should do
These new changes suck. Every day it adds contacts to my phone I dont want. It keeps opening the app store to get me to download apps. Once these changes are fixed it'll get 5 stars.
good
Very, very funny videos,  I love it.
This app does have flaws but it serves my purpose. Would like to see it get better

I hate how it eats up my memory.
It is awful in everyway and would highly reccomend that all facebook users do not update to from the previous versions
Nice
Ok
Baaaaad
Meh... it's okay.

When someone liked or commented, the app fails at times.
.
It good but i can't tag on any picture now..please fix it
Lately, fb app had been syncing contacts without permission. Had to uninstall app and use browser. So inconvenient. Please fix this.
In android facebook has lots of problems please fix it........
Did not work on Sony experia 4
Its awesome
I Don't Trust Either But Browser "Seems" The Lesser Of Two Evils (Also, Auto Hate Sync Contacts)
I don't like it
Why not installed why error
It works very good but it has some faults like  when i try to open account settings it takes to much time
If i enable contact sync it closes after 5 seconds when opened
Its good
Very helpful to browse the site

can't display all pictures on the feed
I love the app
Since two updates ago, the app will freeze and I have to hit home button to exit. But 5 secs later, that app reopens itself each time, still frozen. I force close the app, and it still does it. Have to open another app to make it quit. But still frozen for about another hour before it works properly again. I'm very displeased. Hoped the new update would have fixed it. But it didn't.

Sgt baik
Each Time When I want to launch fb app, its taking a lot of Time saying ' just a moment '...   don't know why!!
Great
Nt fr dis app I jst lik fb
Just look
It is very good
Huff
Why the fb in my internal storage is so much size? It is about 70mb and plus the messenger 30mb, and the fb had many low process in anytime. My storage is not enough for other applications.
I like it but it take error
Slow
love..
Facebook is one of my favourite apps  cause i am able to message my family and friends whenether i want to.
Still slow
Good
Useless!
I have repeatedly set the app NOT to sync with my contacts, but fir some strange reason, it keeps resetting itself to do so. I hope you fix the bug that makes it do that.
It.OK
Superb aap
Good
Better
I can't download the Facebook application in my lenovo tablet of technical reason
I just love it..!! <3 :*
Bcs its a gd scial nt wrk
The reason it is probably crashing is all the monitoring they are doing of everything in your phone. I deleted it when they tried to force another app on me with unrealistic terms of use for a function that existed on facebook already. Then reviewed the facebook app's terms and then I knew that I wouldn't have it any longer. Why does facebook and their messenger app need so much access to your phone? Why would they need to access your microphone and camera before you choose to use it during use of the app?
1 in every 5 uses it closes.annoying
I love it.  Please be fast in loading.
Love it
Slow loading image
Wow
Nic app i like this

Very good media to communications  with friends
Wonderful app
Excellent
Crashes ever since update!
This app normally crashes within the first 5 seconds.
Slowli
You keep making it harder to get to the most recent feed. Now it doesn't even show the notifications on the most recent screen. Go back to being able to select most recent or "top stories" easily like on the desktop. I don't care about the crap from two says ago that I didn't like in the first place that you think is a "top story"

Tired of it updating on its own and showing what it wants. Fb fail
The notifications should be faster
Improve more please
The latest BUG is Amazing!!! It allows the application to crash and close on anything you touch And I never had a problem before on my Galaxy phone and Tablet
Every time I open it like 10 seconds later it closes on me I have tried delting it and reinstalling did not work
Like
Its becoming worst after every update. And now its not even working
Good
Works well on Huawei mercury. And Also on the LG ms323 model.
Husiam
I can never stay on the app for longer than 10 mins.
It is so incredibly inconvenient that I cannot see my messages in this app anymore. Terrible user experience.
Hasan
Ok
It needs to give me poke notifications. I mean to say it should give me the notification whenever someone pokes me. I need this. In both iOS as well as for android. Please add this feature and take your 5 stars.
To many promlemd
Don't get this app! Its stupid trying to make you download facebook messenger screw that!

I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 and the only thing I can do is read the newsfeed. If I click on any other page or link, it crashes. Have wrote to Facebook with no fix or reply so I just uninstalled it. Still works fine on my Galaxy phone. Wierd.
I want to know my pass word

Facebook crashes when I try to do anything.  What to look at a friends page....crash...crash..crash. very frustrating. .please fix..i have tried reinstalling and still does it!
Works smooth.. But sometimes the app just stops randomly
App,I like very very very very very much
Good

I wish Facebook app can be moved to my SD card. I had to uninstall amd disable it as it slows my system.
Since the upgrade, I cannot watch any posted video. Only the sound runs over a frozen image. Please, FB people, check this out.
its good wen compared to messenger
Stop doing things without my permission, and give us options to disable your "features". For example, you synchronized all my contacts WITHOUT asking me if it was ok!! I'm uninstalling it now...
News feeds not working ot working very very very SLOW. Fix it soon.  already for 2 days
Facebook updated become dissaster ! Its hard to log in and it becomes slow ..fix it please ..
Force close is big problem makes it slow.....
Seriously a fail and thumbs down for this.
Need to open on the browser 'coz it always says: "facebook not responding" as well as on my friend's phone. . I think our phones are not the problem @@

F U With Trying To Make Me Download Messenger!
Have not and will not download messenger.  This app just gets more and more annoying. The app simply doesnt work on the galaxy tab3. Everytime i try to read comments or tap a picture for a better look, the app closes or restarts the tablet. EVERY TIME!!!!! This app totally sucks on galaxy tab3. I will uninstall and just use the browser. GFY FB.
App no longer follows links.  Gives an error message.  Had worked fine prior to update.
Great app!!!
Yay im happy with my Facebook app..now I'm taking auto update off so it stays perfect 
I like it
Please make this application movable to SD Card because it eats to much phone memory... Willing to give higher rate if implemented...
After updating galaxy tab 3 to 4.4.2 kitkat it keeps on crashing
Videos don't never work
Old version is better...
nice app
I can only upload videos when I remove the latest update. The latest update is a total battery hog as well.
Even unused it takes more battery that three hours of 3D gaming, and storage vise it's one if the biggest apps on my phone not including messenger which use as much power. So if you phone only runs about a day  remove Facebook +messenger I did now instead of 14 hours of battery I get 40. Why is it so big and use so much power I only use it once or twice a week?  Tested on this phone gets 26 hours, oneplus one gets 35 and galaxy s3 gets18. No other app is as unnecessarily large or use as much power unused
Disappointing me right now!
Could be better an very slow
Good
life is a struggle so be careful
Its awsome
Facebook is great
Very sloww
This is a great app
Its so log and slow

Videos don't load properly...waiting for a vine to buffer takes ages whereas on Twitter it loads immediately
Please update to avoid auto sync..

It worked slowly in mobile but very better
Not good
I've had for at least one year and keeps getting worse. Don't bother.

Yup
Syncs with contacts without permission
Can't get most recent news feed?
Fb
Since the last update all I get is "Trouble loading news feed. Retap to try."
Excellent!
My facebook is blooked help me open facebook
I love this app
I like Facebook but the app has gone down hill since they switched the chat feature to a separate app.
Sadhana mire
1. It would be nice if you could take away one of the the bars on the top. You know, it takes part of the screen.  It makes my screen smaller. I prefer the whole screen free.  2. Other thing is, the app starts on news on the left side and I need to go all the way to the right to get the menu.
Need too much permissions and takes lots of data
The fb update keeps making it sync my contacts. Even after I pick don't sync it goes right back. Please fix this issue. I don't like for my contacts to be synced to fb!
Not bad

If someone would put an option to delete an album on this mobile app, that would be great. Since the last update, I haven't been able to do this.
For the past 2 days, it has not been working it keeps freezing and then tells me that it has stopped working very frustrating.

Links bring you to the wrong place, these idiots are pathetic. And now the jerkoffs want us to install the Messenger app, another battery hogging piece of overbloated crap. Thanks, 20 year old incompetents.
Loved it

I consistently choose not to sync my contacts with Facebook yet the app chooses change my selection and proceeds to do so anyway. I am also unable to view the most recent posts. While facebook tries to show me what is "most relevant" to me with it's top stories,  it is completely wrong. The app would be great if I could choose what I wanted to see and it respected my other settings selections as well
Just loved it..vry convenient aap..:-)
Great..
Its very good app...
downloaded to a new phone but cannot log in force to uninstall it... so bad no fb.... sooon force to deactivate the accnt... FB is not good as before  so bad :(

Closes as soon as it opens
This updated version seems to prevent users to save edited comments. Also,  the notifications seems unable to update accurately all the history of unread news, a lots of skipped notifications not shown. You can only read the updates by scrolling the wall down and down forever

Since the update on this Facebook app, it is really slow on both mobile and tablet, especially on my tablet.  I have noticed that having the facebook app it has decreased the speed of my actual tablet and now my tablet runs tooooo slow. I uninstalled the app and now my tablet is run in at a perfect speed.  This app needs to be downgraded

Problems with sharing Facebook vids
New version is taking time in loading and is very slow
Having the messenger app means giving away my precious ram. Maybe it is convenient for some to have chat heads. It'd be much more convenient for me if messaging and everything else Facebook is supposed to do is included in a single app. In other words, keep it like before.
Nice but loading modt of the time. Why? Can you fix it for good?
:)
Downloading..... . . =.="
Superb app just same as what's up

I can't scroll through my feed without it closing. Please fix (galaxy tab 3)
I used my brother's account.
It lags, keeps crashing and always signs me out. Sometimes it doesn't load. It would be nice if the default news feed is set to most recent, or I could just toggle it in the home screen and not have to scroll to right for more options.
i really loved this app it connects all the friends, colleges, relatives, parents,lovers, worldwide and it helps to share each others feelings etc.
Thanks again
I Wonder there is no option of 0 starts for this app!
Wow great app. It's cool
Constant problems
Nice to cumunicate my frend and to other family

So I upgraded my low-powered tablet to a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and I'm still having problems. Facebook stalls and shuts down every five minutes or so, for no reason at all. The other day I had to try 5 times to post a birthday greeting on a friend's time line because every time I hit the post button Facebook would crash! I have just uninstalled Facebook, rebooted my tablet, and reinstalled Facebook to see if it makes any difference. If I get the same results again, then like lots of other people, I'm done with Facebook! Fix this please!

Every time I am on my tablet, the Facebook app is updating, slowing other things down. Also, sorting my newsfeed by top stories (By whose reckoning?) is annoying. I have given it a chance, and it failed.
Please make the others folder accessible through app. Thanks
Nice

Can't connect
Worst Facebook app so far
it didnt wOrk on my phone nOw.. Fix it....!
Will no longer play video...  Android ultra... Facebook... your app sucks. With every update your app gets worse and worse. Slow as all hell, ... often network errors. I know its the app and not phone...Facebook works fine if I switch to web. For the largest networking site out there we figure you would have it more together.
It automatically enables sync contacts even when disabled,please fix
I like it
Good
I can't imagine my life without Facebook it's my life & every thing.... ..
Oct 10- Contact synching problem still going on this app!! --Since the last update my contact doesnt have their pictures showing anymore. Even unlinking n relinking contacts doesnt work. It s*cks!!!
Concentrate on User interface
Fantastic
I Can't download  help me how can i download in afhanistan
When we re add the any friend into group chat he can't see message properly this is drawback of Facebook.

Hate the fact that it syncs my Facebook with contacts. It adds every person on my friends list with a telephone number to my contact list...i go in change the settings and if I log out it does it all over again!! It's annoying because I don't need nor do I want that to happen.

App constantly force closes or freezes. I detest the fact that I'm forced to download the messenger app, it takes up room and is pointless. Go back to being able to use the fb app to message.

Kind of a delay when you post or change things, and i hate how you have to ask to see recent posts. There's things in my time line from last week... other than that its an awesome reliable app-android hero
Eating too much of my memory ..
Shreyash
Very nice
App crashes every 3 minutes and the messenger is gone
have downloaded it for more than 10 times but it just shows low memory and when downloaded any other app there no such problem at all
Can no longer turn off notifications from app since last update.
So tired of the page jumping all the way back to the top randomly, tired of it skipping around the page. Why not let people who use this app help design it. Would probably be so much better. Fix the bugs and just update it to a new and more flexible and user friendly app. Let us customize it after we download it to fit our preference. Give us lots of options and let us use our app like we want. We are the ones who use it every day. Thanks so much for listening.  I really hope you take this in and use it.
it's amazing
I had unsubscribed notification on mail many times but it still arrive please solve my problem and I will give 5 *
Fix this pos won't let me post anything since this last update
Why it say i will un install... when i leave a group and block a person... its just keep loading but nothing happen... fix it!!!8-_-!
In the past month app constantly closes on its own, tried un installing and re installing but nothing, please fix its becoming really anoying
I think Facebook is not useful but I was wrong it's so useful
Quit good
i like it...so great
Guys.. Keep on adding new features. If we look an year back, app has been developed significantly. Just to add one point, stopping notifications for a status/pic doesn't seem to work properly. Tried to stop notification for a status, unfortunately it din't work out fr me.. Rest all good!! :)
I love the app... Its better than going on facebook through the internet! :D
Every time I try to log in , it will never login & make it worse it will never upload my photos -_-
What a way to document your life productively or unproductive. Some day this will have Skype features and amazon features rolled into one.  Future will belong to one not  all these multiple sites grabbing our information.

Very good to stay in touch with friends nd family
I love it
Good app
Syan
Slower than using the browser, but the browser always tries to push you to the app unless you set your browser to claim to be a desktop. Of course that jacks up the formatting. Coincidence? Yeh, sure. The app also pushes Messenger, probably to get access to all that tasty contact and location data. Never forget: when the service is free, YOU are the product.
I like it
Haven't had issues until this update. Now it takes forever to load.

Very Nice Communication all over in the world....I love it....
The app I downloaded 4 months back was great. Was really easy to keep up with friends and all things happening on FB.  Now, the app closes out on me at regular intervals, and I can't even use the app if I have the facebook messgenger app on my phone. I tried to report, but that didn't even work! So I uninstalled fb everything and just went back to using the mobile site, which is a little more difficult to navigate, but at least it works! FB needs to put it all back like it was!
Facebook is great
Unusable on galaxy tab. Don't waste your time.

Before the update, even with a weak Wi-Fi, it's fast to upload pictures and videos.  After the update, everything is SLOOOOWWWWWW, even refreshing the page is slow.  With all the bad reviews regarding the update, Facebook should not ignore this. I will rate you 5 stars again if you fix this.
it is a amzing apps
Its sinks fb to my phone. I dont want everyones info in my phone
Loved it.
I  really very interesting l..
Good
Downloaded only so I could upload a video, never again! So slow, always freezing, and sent me 6 text messages to let me know my account was accessed. A few months ago I downloaded and removed it because it was the same so clearly it hasn't been fixed. Don't waste your time especially considering all the information they want for a app that doesn't even work
Poor update  Cant like to use facebook.  Stopped all of a sudden
Awesome apps

Belakangan setelah update terakhir, kok FB sering hang yaa? Padahal app yg lain aman2 aja ga ada problem. Bisa diberikan update bugs-nya yg bikin lemot? Thx
Jo kisi ki bat nahi sichta hai
I don't mind being told what to do in my life buy I'm not a big fan if having 2 apps from Facebook on my one and one that really just works for sms. I like it how it was . If it's going to he changed then remove the option from the original facebook app. I just in install and reinstall the app to gain access to.messenger again for a few days it's a minor I convenience rather than bow to somebody who I'd forcing something upon me. I like Facebook but I'm not a fan of the direction it's going.

Good initiative by FB for everybody for keeping in touch for their social life....

The recent updates have broken most everything but basic functionality. You can view main profile pages and pics but about etc never loads. Same for notifications. It shows them but often never loads what the notification is about.  Pokes are also completely broken and never load. Using moto x with latest Verizon update and latest Facebook Mobile.

Dropped support for messenger, now they're slowly dropping support of profile management. The app is now very limited, with fewer features than ever. skip this and goto the website and backup your data while they're still around

Besides the fact that they force you to download the messenger app to chat. I love it!
Bagal namn
Is a good app to stay in touch with family and friends with out having to call them but it sucks because if you make a mistake you can't edit it so you can fix your mistakes
Its really a awesome app.... need some improvement
Good
Need Many Features., Read Later, ...
So poor app i don't like....

Facebook is my life

Syncs my contacts even after my settings say not to. The FB settings change by themselves
I have tried deinstalling/reinstalling, and it still kicks me out frequently.
Update the application, please. Too many bugs.
Nice
Nice appy store
Monthly rates
Same mess as always. Only get posts from days ago.
Updated my phone and won't let me install it anymore wft  like
For chatting friends and loveones.
Cannot check my message without fb message..very uselles
Problem
Crashes all the time, cant even get into my page crashes before it conects. Please fix or i will uninstall.
What the hell are you thinking.  I don't like half these people.  I use my phone for business and do not want to scroll through 400 odd names for a select few. It's ridiculous.  Will be uninstalling if not rectified.
I give you 5 stars because I like you more than Friend Caster. You have much more options and it is more organized! You can't tag on the other app and all your stories from centuries ago come out and it bugs me. You have to make this app more faster and quicker on loading. Try making some new arengments so the app could work better. The rest works fine for me.
Would think that after all these years of Fb, my phone would handle the Fb app.... Surprise....
This app takes forever to load and most are having trouble from sync contact's and have never gotten a comment back this app needs help I only use it to post pics on here. ......
Will good for people on go
Good
Hope it works well with out any problem

You know you love FB. Admit it.
Because I love so much this application.so I need some applications to my phone so that I can learn this application
Who's ready to go back to Myspace
Easy to use db
Nice application but one big problem video download option is not available.So please add video downloading option..........
Little slow app  but other then slow all are ok.....
Awesome
Best
Please make an action to it because im only using galaxy ace
Battery draining nightmare. I hate this app! And I don't believe what they say about not reading my phone's texts in the help section on this new update. Facebook can read your phones messages.

I just hope more entertainment for it.

I love it it's the best there us no other app better than this one
Now it keeps closing on it's own at random times. I'll be scrolling thru the newsfeed and it just force closes. It doesn't freeze. It doesn't warn me. It just exits.
Good
fix it or I will deadlist this app
I updated my Facebook this morning and it was supposed to make everything better.  WRONG!  Facebook is slower, it jams and gets stuck much more, it had slowed down everything on my phone.  My phone has frozen more times today than it has in the past year combined.  Facebook needs to get their act right and do it soon because this is deplorable.  It was actually better before this update.  So how in the world does this app crash... 6 times in one afternoon.  FIX YOUR CRAP!
Terbaik
do no load faster and can't message from it
Fantastic
V.good
In it all is good

Blue n cool
Good..

slow but steady
Poa
Just hate it when u say u dont want to sync ur contacts.... eventually does some how and had ebough with this dumb app
Love
There's no difference after several updates and the application still freeze and "exit" by itself without fail everytime i use it...
Keeps closing
Very Nice
Good
LOVED IT
This app is horrible. Commands don't work. Crashes often. Also frequently forces you to do things you don't want like syncing contacts and additional problem causing apps. This app is not user friendly and will harm your phone on a constant basis. Absolutely ghastly!
Ads, crapware, spyware, lags, crashes. Maybe key logging.
I love it was cool
Why the search function not same like the older one with filter features, this update was sucks
Bj
JD
Liked it
Screw Facebook, trying to get its fingers into all my apps and syncs with my phone automatically... nope screw that
Great
I hate the new update of Facebook on the phone!   -_-   Now getting use too.
No ._.
Half the time the app doesn't even respond and when it does the newsfeed takes ages to load. Do your self a favour and use the mobile site through your browser, this is a complete waste of memory.
Love it !!!!
Aapke sapno ki duniya...

facebook crashes everytime i somebody's list of uploads..
Great app
Bt Net work slow
The photos are not appearing after the new update !!!!!!!!!!!!
Have loading errors still!!!  Please fix soon.
Facebook active
Like it a lot
Just closes for no reason, sometimes cant post. Horrible
Really wish uploading pictures didn't degrade their quality so much. There's no point in having a good camera if the quality reduces to less. Also should change the upload photos interface, "Camera Roll" is really slow and I'm sure I and lots of other people would find it more convenient to just be able to select an album to pick from like every other app. VIDEOS ALSO DON'T LOAD. It throws an error display.
Need a non battery draining option to stay logged In
Simpl owsm..
Very excellant
Mah dick
Why it Always update here in my android phone?
Facebook I just now joined 4 the first time ever

Keep trying to get my phone number and gain all contacts on my phone book so now I have to scroll down like 500 people to find someone so I'm pretty much does deleting it Facebook !
Waste of time.....heavy space consumption.....!!!
It's Very Slow and unupdate
It keep syncing my contacts its annoying I have 5000 friends I dnt need 5000 contacts after I disable it im uninstalling
No
Goes to playstore everytime just to open it nstead of goin directly to facebook! Its stupid, & didn't need yet another update! + can't get more than 30 notifications, so u miss a lot of yours unless u check constantly! Please fix or change back to last version! It worked, this ones halfass! & NOW NEWER UPDATE WON'T LET U GO TO ACCT SETTINGS ETC, IT TAKES U TO THE NEWSFEED IF U TRY! REALLY HOW HARD IS THIS TO GET RIGHT?! WHY KEEP CHANGIN IT WHEN ITS WORSE EVERYTIME?!
The new update is awful. It syncs all of the Facebook data and phone numbers onto my phone without permission and I keep manually going in and unsyncing it but somehow the data reappears on my phone a few hours later. This is very irritating and is causing my phone to run extremely slow. I do not appreciate it and it needs to be fixed immediately.
Moving
i like this app very much
.
Low rating because navigating through screens is very hard especially when browsing quite a bit. Have to hit the top left back button several time to get back to my newsfeed and notifications. You do realise android phones have a dedicated back button for that purpose THIS IS NOT IOS. It used to be perfect before now it's clunky. Try take a step forward and not limit yourself to iOS's rules. It would be great if you could have the bar with newsfeed and notifications visible at all times.
Its just dumb for two apps to do a thing that one app can do
I love Facebook
Best
Rather use it on my computer or not at all
Changing my ratings for it is not already low quality.
Keeps closing unexpectedly on my galaxy tab 3 :( even after reinstall
You've screwed up my Facebook acc and sick of trying to get back on.
Good
i cant even open the app since the last update.. FIX THIS PLS...
I lyked it the most. ...The fastest way to communicate

Always error loading news feed
Mine also closes when i try to share, post comment ! On both my tablets ! Get it together !! Works on my cell. Closes after like 1 post !
Good but always a trouble once every update
Cannot post or share newsfeed photos anymore...says there was a problem...had no issues until the last update..7/7/14...HTC evo
I like facebook use it like it love it.
I do like having access to ask my friends, but I do not need anything else.why does it take up so much space?
I don't want to sync my phone with Facebook and ever since I did this last update it has automatically synced my Facebook contacts and I don't like it. Fix it or I delete Facebook and deactivate my account. I'm done. No five stars till u fix this problem.
love one another
Always forced closed when I open  my fb.
No comments
Sucks
Every Time I update my profile picture. I have to change my password!!!  WTF???  I keep getting trouble loading feed and cannot retrieve feed now.  FIX THIS!!!
Family
Total lack of respect for peoples privacy
My profile
It took so long to refresh & the news feeds are always Top Stories even if I always choose Most Recent. Worst for the albums not updated after picz are uploaded.
Irye
Good version
App
U start video calling in  Facebook
When I exit out of this app it still runs in the background when it didn't do that before. Sucks that it does now
Crashes, self closes, wont share posts cant comment, whats the point, and why is it so hard to fix, what have you guys done. It also seems like no one from facebook cares, ive submitted multitude of complaints, and no fix in sight. Totally and simply useless.
I hate that Facebook has used up 1gb of my data and I'm never on my phone
Crashes each time I try to open it!!!!!!!
Facebook apps make irritated me now it's take to many time for open nd now she don't notify me about any massage yeah cmmnt pls fix it now for karbonn smart a52
App sucks...continues to throw me off and lock up my phone. Use to be ok but now it is aggravation
It lags a lot now ...... and please at least make it to where I can, move to sd card,  this app takes up a lot of space.
I think the app is just fine, but hate that it tries to force me to use Messenger. I dont like that app so I have to use the web version if i want to read or send messages.
I dont like messenger it very slowly for samsung galaxy..
loved it
It's so annoying that everyone uses Facebook, but this is the best android can offer! The people at FB cannot put things in date order (even when Most Recent is selected, you still get updates from weeks ago) every morning I have to select Most Recent, which is still not in date order. The photo up loading selects EVERY single photo on my device, instead of selecting folders to choose. It can't even link to links in a web page! There are a LOT more details, but I can't list them all. Basically, you're stuck
I run a lot of my online business through Facebook. This, messenger and Pages is a must! Love it!
What u all r talking about.
Dislike icon is very important to add
Good great grand wonderful
I use it on my Tablet and it randomly closes on me....super annoying
but i can't chat with my chat messages
awsomw best app ever
What I already said.

Im have problems with the app it keeps closing down when even when liking or commenting on something ive updated the app but still does it
Pls help to able to change the font size
You should be able to change the colour from blue
Please fix.. still crashing   FIX PLEASE!!! It's terrible..
Cool
I have just been disconnected because my wi fi battery is drained,when i turned it on and connect to facebook, error is always appearing,please fix this
Fun
Are you kidding me.  Everytime i start watching something or switch or click whatever it is i get booted out.  Ever since i downloaded the update.  Totally uninstalling, maybe if i decide in few months to redownload you'll have it fixed by then.
Goes a little slow but besides that everythings awsome!!!! TTU
I like this app
It sucks bad! I hate it! !!!!! :!
Since the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 system update it force closes every time I open it. Don't know if it's a problem with the tablet or if it's a compatibility issue with the app.
Facebook is now crap. Please do something about the frequent crashes
Slow asf but i think its my phone

Slow connection
This app needs a total reboot. First of all it has decreased the space of interface, no matter how big your phone screen is, the android app has made the app screen so small that it's irritating after having used the version 1.0.
Awesome

Last update was very annoying! It takes 5 minutes before the app opens! 
My back button hasn't been working so anytime I click on a pic to look at it I have to force close the app to close the pic n basically restart the page
Nice

Facebook application is too big! It crashes my phone when launched.

I literally can't use my app without WiFi. It says error after error and I have good service and no mobile data problems. It only loads things and let's me update my status when I am connected to WiFi. Please fix this because it is getting very irritating.

Why is the downloading slow?
Don't like the way Facebook is screwing with our phones the way they change every thing all the time and freezing up all the time sucks
Why do i need a separate app to chat!
Ever since I upgraded to the latest version, the facebook app loads and closes automatically. Need this fixed urgently.

I would have given it five stars if I could still save a pic to my phone (from the timeline/thread) without sharing it. I like to save the recipes and diy pics.
Ever since the newest update facebook is constantly shutting down. I have cleared the cache, cookies,  and even conducted a factory reset on my device. Please fix this and I may change my rating.
Even I have a fast internet connection the photo is still slowly to appear fit this problem if their is 0 star I'll give or a negative star to express my problem more

Automatically sync of my phones contacts and my friends list!   Uninstalling....                             Wants too much access to personal information on my device!
I like it a lot better now! I just wish I could view my ''others'' message folder on it
Even on a high-end device it takes forever to load, and when it finally does load, crashes...poor facebook, can't afford to make a better app.

Videos don't work again, they crash half way through
So every day multiple times a day. I am constantly going to app settings to disable sync contacts. But every time I turn around this app automatically changed it back. I don't want Facebook with my contacts. You give the option to turn off but really it never turns off. So deleted off phone till they fix this.
Mr
Take way to long and it freezes on most of the videos y entre muchas cosas tambien
I think this app is best friendship app,but this app not friendly with our smartphone because its very hungry use our ram,and cant move to our external data,can u fix this?

Love it
Couldn't live without it
Neither facebook or its continuous updates work properly. It closes suddenly which gets me annoyed since it happens a lot.
Why are my facebook friends all of a sudden linked to my phone contacts? I've always had that option turned off and now all of a sudden I can't seem to make it stop no matter how many times I unsync.
Why does the seen time for a message keep changing? Is it supposed to be like that? I don't think so. Also time since last active for messenger and Facebook are different for some reason. This is really confusing and annoying.
Can't get facebook app on my phone does anyone know why or what fb app I can install
Not a good
O.send 2 emails thhats its not working and yall ignoring???!!! Please fix and i give 5 stars and good comments
Even after flashing tablet, constantly closes out of app.
Updated Candy Crush and lost my access to Facebook . Can't request help from friends and my game started over. Not a happy camper.
Good app
No other choice! !!!!!!
IF I WANT MY FACEBOOK CONTACTS SYNCED WITH MY OTHER CONTACTS I WILL DECIDE THAT ! I DONT NEED YOU TO DO IT EVERY TIME I SIGN IN !!!!
Its allright.
Since the update, I can't launch the app, fix please.
I'm having problems with my Facebook account. Please help me fix it
Slows phone down big time and causes freezing! App just too big. Maybe if it was possible to move to external SD card, I wouldn't reluctantly have to uninstall. Please try to make it possible!
Simply
Can't sync to my contacts on one plus one. Need a 3rd party app and that I don't like to use specially when it's available on other devices.
Awesome update
Since i updated the new version,  i can't view photos on my account... Please fix it

Why in the hell did you guys make an automatic  sync  TAKE  IT OFF. Give us the option
Why I must install tow apllication for one
Just can't install an app on my handset by itself. Every time i have to do it through this page on a computer as the phone wouldn't complete the installation and keep showing erroe numbers 923, 495 etc. I guess Samsung is good for nothing. Never had any problem with IPhone, Ipad or Nokia. I m regretting the moment  bough this Samsung set and I swear this is the last thing I ever purchased that has Samsung written over it.
So the only thing I would request is that the mobile app would tell you how many friends you have like it does on a desktop.
I hate this app it keeps on bothering me well iz just a stupid app
Why is it auto sycing contacts?
It's good
Good
I don't want messenger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This app ok but slow and na2s things tanya :-P
Fine when it's working but drives me nuts when constantly having to change my password!
Not able to see options as easily with app.  Wish you could see birthdays as easily as you can when you are using a regular computer.  I don't like that you have to use Facebook Messenger to send messages.  I preferred using the regular Facebook message area.
You'd think being around for a while would indicate your company has worked out all the kinks in the app for your product. Not so for Facebook, it would seem. Despite numerous "improvements", the app is still gloriously sub par. Facebook chat & interface-related issues aside, the previous update made it nigh impossible to open a link without Chrome force quitting. Luckily, the newest update has fixed that problem: Now, I can't open links at all. Thanks, Facebook! You've saved me from the nefarious internet!
loved it
Kishan
Ol
Awsome.
I tried to verify my Facebook account and it wouldn't send me an email or text message.
Logout not work  :(
notifications r always late
FB keeps turning on contact sync without my permission. I have shut it off in my phone settings and in the FB app and then FB turns it back on. There appears to be no way to turn it off and keep it off. I am done with FB on my phone. The app is getting deleted and the web version will probably be deactivated soon.
Good
After the new update Facebook stays open on my phone and starts to drain my battery
application crashing after last update..please fix

One star says it all. Only on my phone so I can comment on ESPN forums.
It crashs a lot. For no reason.
This app is crap every time I use it it freezes my phone. Fix it. Not every app has to be made for an iphone....make apps for androids
Seriously on the verge of uninstalling. Every single time I get on fb it asks to wait or force close.
I usually don't have problems with it but if i do its once in a blue moon.
There are loads of apps like this out there
Every time I want to update fb my tablet creases , it lonely happens on Fb update

Hey its skyler I hate this
It's OK
Helps talk to family
The constant notifications from friends of friends is very annoying. If you are not in my friends list I don't want to see what you wrote to someone who is on my friends list.
Oi
Keeps doing sync contacts.  I change it so it won't sync  and it goes back to sync contacts.
I don't get notifications from this app I just see number symbols which let's me know I have a notification but no actual alert from the phone itself. And all my alerts are on
Nice!
Facebook does not work. Keeps closing app. I cannot post or do anything. Same with messenger. So done.
Facebook
Good
It's a nice app.but it's a day behind when it update new stories to page.
Yes
Plz plz make better one
I think its good n it lets u know about ur friends
Keeps closing, news feed is never up to date, photos and videos never load plus many other problems with this app. Not fit for purpose. Uninstalled this app due to never ending issues. Plus can't view videos as my tablet doesn't support flash player. Absolutely useless app
Wawww

Very. GOOD!:-)
Every time I click a link the app automatically shuts down and a message pops up saying whatever app the link is for has "stopped working"
Excellent
10/11: Started shuttung down randomly again. Worked for a bit.  ...Old post:Has started shuttung down today after update was installed
Very slow... doesn't work good
A mess trying to log out / log in, crashes constantly. News feed is a real p.o.s.
It's crap..
Its three cuz i can hardly play my videos on my news feed
The newest update accessed my phone contacts without my permission and ignored the fact I have it set to not sync. I removed the app as soon as I realized what they had done and will not be reinstalling it. It is not worth it and Facebook is not important enough for me to be okay with them accessing my phone contacts.
LOVE IT!
Wont let me install app says incompatable :-/ wtf

Very good ")
Easy way to relation

Suupeer
It's ok but it makes me wait alot for it to open Plz fix it.
Why is that Facebook can take pictures and use your audio with out your conformation 
Ok
Great way to post on mobile and check status and nptifitions and stuff
The app continues to run in the backround even after backing all the way out. Never has before. Have to use app killer to completely close it every time. Stupid!
It's nice
The fact that it forces you to download Facebook messenger sucks
I like it
What is going on with FB since the recent update?  I can't get past one minute without it shutting down over and over again! Sometimes it's every 30 seconds! Samsung tab 3 10.1....it KEEPS CRASHING! I see many people are having the same issue. Please fix it!! Your update has BUGS!!! FIX THE UPDATE FB!!!!!!  DO you read these issues FB? Please let us  know at least that you are aware and trying to resolve....please!!

Facebook
It keeps on asking for updates everytime
WTF?? After the last update it doesn't even open! Hate it. Really H-A-T-E  I-T.
Facebook
Upgraded from a 2 star now it doesn't crash every 3 minutes.
Auto sync contacts really? Fix it now until then its uninstalled
UH THE LAST 3-4 DAYS I AIN'T GOTTA GET ON
Nice
Soooooo   nicceeeee
Its a good app but everytime I get on facebook all my facebook contacts go on my phone so everytime I get on facebook I have to turn it off and its really annoying I have to do it everytime.
Play store
Do yourself a favor and delete this app and make a bookmark on your browser then make a shortcut. Boom. Now you can free up the 5000 GB this app takes up on your device
Awesome
Best media
It dose not show up on the screen it only says its down loaded on my phone
Ever since I entered Facebook at 2009. I liked it very much because chatting to friends was so fast and easy. But five years later, with the rise of Smartphones, Facebook forces users to switch to the Messenger app and won't allow users to get into their messages unless they download that app. SO, WHY THE H THERE'S STILL A MESSAGE ICON IN THIS APP!?
Videos don't work
As an iPhone user, for many years, I often wondered why so many android usersbcomplained about the Facebook app. Now I know.  It's missing basic features like the ability to comment on comments.  It's laggy... I dislike this app so much I'm taking the time to write my first negative review EVER!
Wonderful
Love it
A lot more improved performance.
I Do
Love it!
Runs up my data
Constantly opens in my background running up my data after being forced to stop. Syncs itself to my phone when I repeatedly unsync everything.  Not my favorite app
Great
....awsome
This is great i thought i first it was gonna be boring but then i download it and its great;) thanks for making facebook
Good one
Awesome
I'm having an issue with it where it won't let me change my relationship status. I've been trying to change it from single to in a relationship for about 2 days now and it's getting really irritating. My boyfriend can't do it on his either. Please fix this.
This app keeps freezing on my LG G FLEX. WHEN I SCROLL THROUGH MY NEWSFEED AND A VIDEO COMES UP IT FREEZES FOR LIKE 10 SECONDS AND THEN WHEN THERES IS ANOTHER VIDEO IT FREEZES AGAIN. PLEASE FIX THIS, IT DOESNT HAPPEN WHEN I SCROLL THROUGH PICS. NOT SURE ITS BECAUSE OF THE PHONE OR THE VERSION OF FACEBOOK. I HAVE THIS GETS FIXED WITH AN UPDATE. ITS ALREADY ENOUGH I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ANOTHER APP JUST SO I CAN TEXT SOMEBODY.
5 for older version. 2 for new.

Image shows very slow others wise nice
When I open the app half the time it goes to my cameras gallery. Also, I hate looking at a post and the feed going haywire and going from posts that are 6 hours old to 15 minutes old back to 6 hours. Makes it confusing at times to know if I'm up to date with posts.
Everybody just wanna hate
Cool
Home wants me to update fbbut theres no update available.
Getting mad on diz stupid app.... browsing fb on any other browsers is way better than diz!!!

Disgusting after update.............
Everytime I attempt to open it, I keep getting an Error code, won't let me refresh, post, look at posts I was taged in, and locks up. Uninstalled it, and reinstalled it, but it still has the error message coming back up. Sent numerous notifications to Facebook, but no help yet. Been this way for 24 hours now.

This app is the worst for many reasons. But mainly it's like Jerry springer for social media. Also big brother is watching you on this app and how it uses people as lab rats for their own purposes.
Verry
It so awesome
Becux Last upDate waS Fine buT tht is very Sloww
Keeps punting me out of Facebook!!! Am not happy!!

Since i update my Facebook it took 5-10 minutes to open, always stuck up  on "Setting up" please help me to fix this. Gonna change the rating when my problem is done. Thank you :)
Its ok.
This app worked well for a while. Suddenly close when you try to share posts.  Have uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Really pissing me off now.

Very nice after download this ap
I have always had it to where it doesn't sync with contacts and now it does randomly and about 3 or 4 times a day I have to go back into the app to keep turning it off when I don't turn it back on. If people this app doesn't get its crap together it's getting deleted and looks like everyone else agrees. FIX THIS NOW! OR GOODBYE
App constantly closing when I'm scrolling. Annoying !

I recommend downloading Facebook it is a great app and it is very addictive
Stop syncing my contacts WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!  Facebook used to be fun and informative.  Now, it's simply a nuisance.  Bye, bye. Using the browser app only from here on.
Add your internal browser
Download app because not install

When will you guys fix most recent feeds???? After me than 6 updates still not working
Runs in background all the time, draining the battery! I still get double posts from a page that I've liked. If you tap on a post from page you've liked, go and read the story/article/watch a video; when you come back to your newsfeed; Facebook will start you all the way back to the beginning of your newsfeed! You then have to find the post you were just at to leave a comment, like, or just continue were left off while trying to read the feed! It's really absurd what some of the permissions truly require!
What in the world is an error "- 24" I don't understand I got MORE than enough space for this shiz.
It keeps coming up saying install messenger and wont let me read my messages until i have installed it but my device isnt compatiable with messenger it needs sorted immedtly please

It constantly closes itself, im thinking about boycotting it because I only have access to a tablet so I cant even check my fb
I have an HTC One, that's a lightning fast phone,in every way, and in every app....but NO.... FACEBOOK IS TAKING 5 MINUTES TO LOAD A PHOTO. FIX IT. AND IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR USERS HAPPY FIX IT BEFORE I'M 99 
This update is horrible!! I can't fix my timeline to where I can see recent status's first. Its all out of order!! Fix it or I will uninstall!!

I had fb for year rarely a problem, after an update it been awful.  Now I am just unistalling it. Good job Facebbok for not helping your users feel important.

coz it require messenger the people who does not like to use messanger then what they do????
After update fb did not open, started heating up the device. Fb always has been very heavy app taking toll on phone's available resource. Guys, write fb from scratch with better design.
I love facebook its life but it also takes to long to load I would just change that
Luar biasa

App will not stay open on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S3.  When I try to comment or open pictures or even just scrolling, it closes! This has happened since the last update. Works great on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Phone. Please help!!
I can post but I can't like comments or post in the comments section.
Great
I've noticed that every time Facebook updates their app, my phone won't connect to it via data. It will only work on WiFi, and as I have unlimited data I would like it to work with data. I'm using an LG Optimus G. Also videos on facebook will play the sound but not the video unless I play with the volume keys constantly.
Always good
Thus app sucks it freezes to much
Newsfeed is not working properly....plz upgrade the version...
good
Is wonderful
Really superb because we can easily communicate with anyone
Tapping on any link that's in a post causes Chrome to stop.  This is not an issue with Chrome, as I have checked out in every other social network I use.  This is purely a Facebook issue, and these things need to be addressed before making any other ancillary tweaks.
Good app

Ever since the most recent update fb does not like to let me log out when I am done with my session. This is very frustrating bc it is eating up my data. Every time I want to log out I have to go into my app manager and 'force stop'. It's a bit ridiculous.
I hate the fact that Facebook sync your contacts without asking.  That's some bullshit and because of that, I am deleting my Facebook app. I do see that I'm not the only person how hates that.
Everyone should get it
You may read your news feed, but clicking to comment, like, etc will close the app. Actually any click closes the app on my tablet. Very frustrating and has made me stop using it and go outside to smell the roses. Seems like a win for me.

Uses an incredible amount of memory and DESTROYS your battery!! Was even notified by 'clean memory app' of this, but already knew it.   ... also the feed goes from around 15 minutes right to two hours in the recent section.

It sucks up megabytes after megabytes into the cache. I am having to go through once a week, and dump close to a gigabyte of store data. Even with cache cleaners installed, I am still having to do this. Facebook is not even that cool anymore, and certainly not cool enough to have to dedicate time dealing with cache cleaning issues.
It's nice...

Good app, except it forces contact sync even when sync is disabled. Could you please fix that, its very annoying. Do not appreciate having to deal with facebook contacts everytime i go to my Contacts List
Narendra ni hai
The app wont open on my samsung galaxy tablet. It just glitches out and closes as soon as it loads. Fix this and the app will be good again.
Every time I download Facebook it takes all my storage space I delete all my games and still takes all my storage space I give this 1 star
Very bad
Good bla
Nice
Awesome app
Nice the bezt app yet
It wont let me upload videos unless i uninstall the update..
Used to hate this app but it has massively improved over the times. Very easy to use and all.. I use the mobile version more than the website one. One request is to please let us edit the custom privacy settings. I have to open the website on computer if I need to add a person to the privacy list. Other than that, wonderful. 
Love it
This app needs to be worked on. It's syncing contacts without permission now I have 4876 contacts in my phone.

Why do you need to have a separate app for the messaging. Too much memory usage. Also. The privacy issues of messenger. Please fix this. I use twitter and Instagram more than Facebook because of that. Please. Thanks.
rubbish
My favrt app
Won't let me log in says insufficient space after I canceled apps then every time I try again I have to start the whole process over thought I really wanted Facebook but now I don't know to much trouble to join
The app version of facebook is really good, its fast, easy and all the good things, but with all these good qualities what spoils it is that they force you to download the fb messenger.
When i try to watch any facebook videos its crashes please fix this

I like thiss app!
Can't even use it. Takes up to 10 minutes to startup and then crashes. Crashes all the time. You should aim on making this app light, especially since not everyone who uses Facebook has a high-end smartphone. Needing Messenger just for chatting wasn't a pretty good move since some people don't use Facebook mainly for instant messaging. I have figured that using my browser for mobile facebook is a lot better than using the app itself.
I love this app coz i can connect to all of my family and friend.
Man
Hearing from people havent talk to in years
Integrates to everything on my phone. Just needs to be a bit more flexible. Syncs contacts without permission. Even though sync has been disabled.
force close when logging out!!!
thanks.
Getting worth with every update moreover why we have to download facebook messenger then it's really big and too slow

Not fond of an app that requires basically all permissions from my phone, and the chat app is even worse. Not only that, but I see advertisement popping after i exit the chat app. No privacy!

Well, I had updated this review. Why so slow? Why? I didn't wants to argue anymore about this! I must waits for five minutes and even longer than that. So frustrated! Please fix ! Please begging! Really loves this app though. The update seems useless to me. It's just an update without anything. Ok,ok,. I will stop right now. Guess what? I really loves this app! Simply but limited edition to me._
Nice but not better than watsapp

Eats away the memory and also the battery
Whats the point of giving the option to check messages in the app if everyone was already forced to get messanger? And quit stacking updates, this app took up almost all the space on my phone.
After the update,  the app doesn't doesn't play the systems notification tone anymore when a notification comes through.. it plays that knock that you hear when a whatsapp message gets sent.. also it would be nice to be able to save videos from the news feed to the device
Ok,Ok
It's bad apparently.  It's alwase stop working

This application is not bad: )
Unsuccessful update.
Love this app
Despite seemingly disabling all location related services within the app (ie. for posts and messenger) Facebook still turns on GPS on random occasions and uses it to excess, seemingly for no reason whatsoever. The only way of stopping it endlessly doing so is to remove it from the list of running apps.

Why cannot download fb walau
The latest update made the app act crazy. Sometimes pics wont appear I need to close app ang open again very annoying. Even options of reporting comments and status has been removed
I love Facebook and have an perpetual relationship with it.
But gets worse with each update. Click on a link then going back to fb and the news feed is back at the top. You can only watched videos on this app's video player, which gives you little control over the video. Defaults back to top stories everytime. And now it keeps crashing! I often just give up and use my computer instead if I'm at home.
I like the app, but will not install another app for messages, and do not like being nagged about it.
Whenever I try and open a link to a article or website from my newsfeed Chrome will open but failed to do anything else. It either doesn't load another card to go to that site or open the last card and still doesn't go to what I asked for

Fuckin app no playing videos again
Don't Install On Android! Had the version just previous to this update, videos stopped working. Heard horror stories about installing this update on android but did it anyway. It took over my phone, crashed it several times, killed the battery within 20mins without even using the app and it took over the touch screen to where I thought I needed to have it replaced. I uninstalled, have original version from phone 2yrs old, phone worked perfect after a few hrs of uninstall. FB has got to get its act together!
Excellant
Lovely
Its nice
Everytime I logout and login again with my other account it would become login failed. I'll unstall and install again. Sooo hasle!

No updates please this is starting to be awkward
In any of the high end phones I've had... Sluggish, crashes for no reason, battery drainer. I seldom use it.
I ended up deleting this app after reading all the permissions I was giving it. Why do you need to read my text messages and record audio?! I thought FB Messenger was bad. I'm sticking to the web version from now on.
Gf
Need the new version please. Upgrade.
Could not install it on my phone.
Am facing log in and lod out problem

I should have never updated to the "new" version. Nothing better then working backwards.
very useful
In the last version of the app, at least I had the choice of either seeing top stories or most recent stories. Now I am forced to see top stories, the only way I could see most recent is that I have to go into feed and then pressing most recent, I don't want to see top stories. I at least have the choice of either seeing most recent or top stories. :( I want a choice so I can change it. Thank you, I hope you help me with this problem. After the recent update the videos dont show properly, it just stops!!!!!

Forcing to get the app is stupidity without leaving an opportunity to hang on to the old one. It's brutal
It keeps crashing and it would never do that on IPhone. I still like my galaxy and Facebook isn't really that important anyways. But still fix the effin crash problem you numb skulls

Hate it even more now! It takes days to load pics on posts. I now have to just open in browser. It is now a USELESS ap! No stars!
The good app
Like everyone else has said, there are a few annoying features such as it automatically syncing contacts. However, I simply think the app is just getting too big; this is the only app I am capable of having on my phone, Sony Xperia Tipo, as the app takes up far too much space with all of the unused novelties recently introduced in the past few updates. I personally think that the size should be cut down; all the bugs and kinks knocked out; and updates focus on speed and reliability. Thank you.

It is very slow ... And it takes a lot of memory... I am a Galaxy Y user
I cany even use the app
Why you have to have two apps to run Facebook I don't know. Both take up a lot of memory, so if you unit is running slow now you know why. I would much rather go back to the old school way. You don't gain anything more out of the apps, they even stopped the little number on the desktop icon to tell you how many messages you have. As the dragons say, for that reason, I'm out!!!!

It's better to have facebook on Google chrome, Than to download this very slow application.
Videos wouldn't play so i updated the app. Now every time i try to view a video it wont play or force closes the app. Im over this bs. And the app honestly takes up way too much space for the android phones that dont have a ton of memory.

Spam to the max, every time I share something it keeps popping up some stupid sh#t recommendation or ad. Also forces you to install Facebook Messenger separately. Why does Facebook need to access your entire phone? To spam you with ads and use your private data. Don't bother.

I refuse to install another app to chat to people. Using my mobile web browser. I cannot believe you are now forcing links to open in a fb 'browser'...
Can not login in new version.

Nice but  its old version
Doesnt open or takes long time to load
Latest update totally breaks the app on my S4. Won't even start, just hangs.
For the first time in ages the App actually works well. It's clean and smooth, however one useful feature you should think about adding is the option to 'edit' comments, like on the PC.
Its best
Constantly crashes on my s3. For no reason? It's so annoying!
Shite. I don't want messenger. End of!!
Amazing
NICE GAME
Awesome
Gak bisa pakai foto profil yg udah pernah q pakai sebelumnya,sekarang selalu mau tukar yg baru trs.tolong fix it please..

Hello
Why do we have to install the fvcking messenger for us to talk to our love ones
Hel o
Facebook becomes our second community we all live in it besides reality!

I believe that Facebook should build a better Facebook app for android.. It's a memory eater, slow, it's stupid really!! Thank u Facebook 
Realy love this :)
Good l
Facebook
Used to be ok, but I would rather not read my messages at all than allow Facebook access to my contact numbers, now it's just a pointless waste of space.
Luv it!!!
I love it..but sometimes feeds arent updating when clicked..
Won't delete search history
Keep getting message facebook.unable to open. Have to try about 10 times before it works. Total rubbish
Hi
Also timeliness doesn't update well.
It's  a bit trouble when log in . ?just for me
P00r
I recently unistalled this app and replaced with Fast Facebook app. The reason quite simply is Facebook had to much access to my phone uploading my contacts and private files without notifying me. Also my phone was not responding to my touch because Facebook was busy using my CPU in the background to do God only knows!. Well we are finished now and both I and my phone are reaping the benefits.
It's OK
Why force us to download your messenger?!!!!

Everytime I sign out of facebook and the sign back in it keeps telling me there was an error of some sort and after 5 times of trying I have to uninstall then reinstall it just to get it to work. Please fix this problem it is getting annoying!!
Nice......
Goood but has to more
Very bad
But its struck very much
It is a terrible app lately! It is blocking itself and other apps, it is imposing the use of messenger and if you refuse using it after a while you'll notice thta neither the fb app is working anymore on your smartphone. Less fb better will be
Since installing...Facebook freezes, stops, is very slow. I wish I'd left it alone. Im very disappointed and about to try uninstalling.

Recent update seems to have a major bug. Doesnt load any images
Nice
This app is good.
Awsm app
Sucks
Five stars for sure. I basically live on my mates account
I like it but it takes so much space
All of a sudden I cannot upload photos or new status update even, it takes ages, i realy mean ages and it just does not do the updates on the page.  Worst facebook app I have had in all the years of owning a smartphone.
Ever since the most recent update, it does nothing more than crash constantly and slow down my phone. FB seems like they are not going to fix it anytime soon.
But i'm still a bit iffy on the size it takes up after every update. I uninstall and install it again to use less space. And it opens faster. Anyway still a great app.

I feel that this version of Facebook, is not too user friendly
Keeps showing newsfeed entries out of order and has no way to Change it. And please either make the app smaller and/or allow it to be moved to the SD card.
I like it
I loved it
Awesome
I just updated the current version I have but I cannot create a new album. Sucks!
I didn't get the update and now it won't open. I got the update and now I can't even find it on my phone! There's no "open" option on playstore and I downloaded it. Wow.
App is very good in all the way but I found only a little problem in video sharing.
Good

If u decided to work messages solely in Messenger, just leave the Message tab there.

Facebooksuperappsveryuseful
I could honestly live without this app, but this is sometimes the only way to contact friends and family.
This app eats up too much memory and with each update, they ask for more and more unnecessary private data, like sms, phone calls.

This ap has become complete garbage ! Froze my phone . Took 30 minutes to uninstall . All because of an auto sync that no one wants. GARBAGE . Will not give you another chance.

Updated my Sony s with your new update and a few other apps and all of a sudden my phone starts playing up. Your app would not load and then force stop and my home screen wouldn't work. Text messages started acting up. I've now uninstalled the update and now my phone is fine. No need to go and buy a new one sort the app out please.
I don't want to install your creepy massager app
The latest update says there is an error when I try and play a video, so I can't play videos and this bugs me. Please fix it very soon.

Ng bezt tok eh...
Its great for using if I can't stand my chrome acting up. But, I absolutely hate the whole new idea of putting all the messages on a messenger that is complicated in itself to use. Otherwise its decent..
Force closes every time when I try viewing photos and make sure whenever someone sends a link over fb messenger it opens in the app and not in my browser! Fix this

Pasok sa banga boom panis !!!
silvaniya,,,,
Its the the Application.
1) What's the point of having the option to NOT sync contacts data when even after selecting that, this app syncs data anyway?? I DON'T WANT MY FRIENDS DPs IN MY PHONEBOOK!!!........ 2) Why in the name of all that is good and pure, can't I have an option to show most recent updates at all times? Why does it reset to your so-called EdgeRank crap? I WANT RECENT UPDATES ONLY!!!!
After the recent so called "update for speed & reliability" my app is continuing to crash every time i open it. Hate the recent update. I wonder a big company like fb can't even fix some damm bug :-(
Keeps crashing please fix !!!!
love it. thanks.
Good
Friends told me to get it instead of loging in from Google
Hse
Every 4 days once app goes log off by itself....

Best app
Ive just updated the app and I'm extremely angry! It changes my privacy settings everytime I open the app and is automatically syncing to my phone, I've already changed the settings back to "no syncing" 3 times today! If it isn't fixed I'll be deleting the app, what is the purpose of privacy settings if everytime I open the app you delete my preferences!

Dude
Dont like the new update
Hi
Facebook's apps are getting frustratingly imposing! It ridiculous that I have to do technological gymnastics just to keep my contacts on my phone from syncing with my Facebook contacts! On top of that, Facebook REALLY wants me to open links in its own browser now, which thank goodness can be disabled. And finally, even though it's a separate app, MESSENGER SHOULD NOT POP UP WHILE I'M WATCHING NETFLIX. You have an easy job Facebook. Just stay in your own app and off my phone!
Thank you

Still pisses me off I need a separate application just for chat but at least the app works better than a few years ago when it used to eternally load all the time.

After the latest update FB wouldn't even open. It kept timing out after waiting forever. After deleting and reinstalling twice it now opens but does not have the home screen icon alert any more. Now I have to check app all the time. Please fix urgently. I use a Samsung Galaxy S4.
I love facebook bcause of my crush that hindi nya alam na crush ko sya wala man siyang kibo ayaw nya ako ifrend sa facebook   T_T

Have installed other video players and made them default. Ticked and unticked auto play. Uninstalled and re installed Fb app. Nothing helps. FIX THIS. Multi billion dollar company should have the rescources and expertise to adress problems.

Having some issues of links not opening in chrome.
Why the hell does it have a browser in it?!? I like having a choice which app opens web links by default. Buggy. Annoying. Less useful than it was years ago. :-/ stop adding features and requiring permissions and make a better core product.

You people are hopelessly worthless.even you are not sure that what you are asking, to open a new account.even you fools denounce my birth date,saying date is wrong.means you stupids know my birth date better then me.And tell me how many phone nos.one could have.if some body is having only one no. And resides in remote area,can't he open a Facebook account.Now I understand why people are lossing interest in f.b.whatsapp was an alternative,but you stone head cowherds bought that too.

Nothing is good in this no new improvement are useable
construction
I download apps very easy and fast but when it comes to this app it won't download at all ..
I apologize because I took out the five stars and I put just one..it is because the app is giving me a lot of problems. Hope you guys fix it as soon as possible, so in that way a can put the 5 stars again.

:(
can't login to my FB there's a frickin error!
superb
With the latest upgrade to android now my fb is always going by byyby
Aaaaaaa
The app crashes all the time, whenever I open the Facebook and Messenger, it shuts down automatically which makes me lose my data. At first I thought it was a virus or maybe my storage was full, but I fixed all of that and it still wouldn't work! :( Now I'm using Facebook on safari to contact my long distanced family... please fix this and messenger because my data was lost or either hacked... :'( I'd hate to rate this app so low after I've been using the old update for 3yrs..since the new one, messenger wouldnt work and wont let me call my mom because it kept saying,"connecting..." and facebook shuts down whenever I look at my friends' timeline, etc. Please fix it. :( Anyone else experiencing the same problems? Btw...my device is iOS 6 and Samsung Galaxy 3 Please vote if you agree they should fix it. ~Karin
But extra cache file
Fine
Wow
This is my second try with this app. I just want it so I can watch the videos on Facebook, but when I try to search a friend, or leave a comment, it literally just quits. Not so much as an error message. No apologies, no explanation, and restarting/rowboat doesn't work. Not much of a network at all.
USING FAST FOR FACEBOOK IS BETTER THAN FACEBOOK ITS SELF, ONLY TOOK 6MB ON MY PHONE INSTEAD 100MB

Super
OK
I just like it a bit
It doesn't work.. i can't open my facebook:(

Yay for me..I don't like fb messenger..
Why i can't upload videos on facebook
Everytime I open this app for a few seconds it closes on me(galaxy tab 3 10.1) since the update please fix this issue

fb messanger does not work Properly, so i want another version ,
This app is constantly messing up. I always get the message "unfortunately Facebook has stopped". Ugh!!!!!
Personally some of the app permissions are bullshit. You dont need to know my texts and personsal information thats in my phone.
Nice
Its. Good
So nice to use it
Never sleep life.
I've now deleted Facebook from my phone. It auto syncs all my friends to my phone contacts and every time I change the setting it goes right back. Sorry Facebook you can't have control of my phone.
Its awsm
hate it.!!! it takes 2-5mins before i open my account.
Can't set news feed to most recent. Why is the app so annoying to use? Why a separate app to send messages? Deleted again for the last time. Get back to talking to people in person!

I would give it a better rating but its starting to suck keep having to force close  fix please!
Takes too much time to be downloaded

This version automatically syncs FB contacts to my phone. Even even when I turn sync off they're still there. Really annoying. Most FB contacts don't even have phone numbers! Please fix.
It slows down my phone, it crashes all the time, please just start from scratch and put out a new app.
Why does it use do much data and why does the data go up all the time why cant i added it with out android its messing my phone please sort it out cus
Nice app
Love Facebook
It   is    a  good   way   to   make  friends
Randomly goes to tablet home screen. No rhyme or reason.
Application is causing my phone to Freeze and reboot..Please Fix!
Doesn't open half the time, forces close the other half. Also runs slow!!!
When i tried to post status, the section of choosing who I want to opt for seeing my post just keep on spinning, even i had good wifi signal and 3G. The Post button just greyed out on me so I cant post anything on my wall or update status. Commenting on other people' posts works just fine. I gotta keep old version instead of this updage. Please fix it. HTC One M8
Was getting better now getting worse, force closes constantly, like every 3 minutes and STILL can't watch videos through the app.  This is getting ridiculous really.  Not happy with it at all.
I liked it!
Thanks fb.
I uninstalled first my apps before I could download it.
Tanveer
Very poorly work
Great!
Like really does Facebook want to sleep with my wife too the privacy issues are ridiculous. Waiting for another format of Facebook to take over.
Won't let me tag certain friends in posts and comments. It also has a bad photo selecting thing.
its a nice app ever..
Until now I must log in in web version for search in group.. please add that option in group (mobile app)
Idc what u guys think I love fB
TAKES UP TOO MUCH EFFIN SPACE!! Won't even let me in at all anymore. Just keeps forse closing me out every time I try to log in. YO CAN YOU STOP UPDATING AND LEAVE IT AS IT IS PLEASE!
Superb apps
I've had to uninstall and reinstall many times, as the app freezes and goes grey only to buzz and tell me there was a problem. Please fix. Not happy...
Need video call and video save option
Delays other applications
Still slow . . Why? Pls fix it. . .:-( , . .irk.
Its a good app
I loved it
For older version
All the way it looks even it is hang not responding , I LOVE IT
Nice
:)
Keeps on saying "setting up Facebook" after I logged out..
The Best But..... I like it but.....
Nice Facebook up pretty compact.
Come'n... Since this apps was updated n I use it... It gets often not responding in my phone...
Are they going to fix it??????  They fixed it.
I hate the new pop up or whatever it is when I share an article
Got to have it!!
Yeah it's Gud
You allow messaging in the facebook app, and get rid of Messenger!!! Listen to your users!!! Nobody wants messenger app!!
Keeps crashing every after at least 5 seconds... How the hell can I post or comment from a different section if I can't keep the app open for 5 seconds... Worst update ever
Drink coke diet pls.
Conection is bad
Boring... Always update everyday.....
The app has been slow to load content such as pics and videos since the latest update. I have tried using it versus the mobile site and other platforms (ios &  desktop) and it is really slow compared to the other versions. Kindly fix asap.
Still having that error with news feed
always force close when i using it
Great
Just when I wanted to give a better rating, it gets worse. Constant crashes on Galaxy Tab. Not as if you people read this or care. Multi-billion dollar company with the worst app on the market. SMH.....
It's Ite
This app is not a faster for facebook surfing
Complete crap
Great
vEry vEry gooOoOood
Too many updates and still can't fix the errors. I can't log in anymore. It closes and does it again everytime I re-open it. No point using it if it can't deliver what I NEED it to be. And why remove the message feature when it's working perfectly and have us force to download a separate app? This app is just not worth for all the troubles and disappointments it brings. Uninstalled it already.
CANNOT DOWNLOAD WHAT IS 498.
Facebook
Kept f0rce cl0se and it takes 20mins bef0re it 0pens
BIJAPUR
Not letting me upload videos
Epic FAIL. The app barely functions and crashes every 30 seconds. I cant use it at all. How pathetic.
Thanks for making it were I can talk to friends and family. And is there any new improvement available and design's that works but the download for the app size is ridicules 20.74
jakkkaass app

Oh I can really get in touch with my ellet friends conster reminder it sucks
Its to nice and esey
nothing
Update SUCKS
Seenu
Don't like that I have to download messenger to message my Facebook friends it's a waste of time and space not to mention it's an invasion of privacy. I will keep uninstalling and reinstalling Facebook to avoid using this app until you'll remove it and my friends and their friends are also refusing to use this app!!!
Too much strict unfair be fair
Loved it
Facebook is a cool creation to just meet up old n new friends n not to be bad,so if u have it just enjoy it
Use to work fine now it keeps crashing. Totally useless to me now.
Ok
I hate the auto sync please take it off!!!!
Amazing
Next step would be good to remove the messages and leave only faces.
My problem is my net in globe
I like the idea of offline likes!
This update is garbage. It auto sync's all contacts with the existing phone book, and there is no way to turn it off. I don't care to look at all of my family members ugly faces every time I want to call someone. Also those contacts don't even have phone numbers. Straight garbage. This update gave me Ebola.
Good app work fine on my Samsung Galaxy S5.
Every time I open this app, it crashes and freezes. Then my entire phone freezes. Argg.
Getting better but sometimes I don't get chat messages :/
Very very good
Gildoluisguambe
I dont want my Facebook friends to be sync with my phon contacts.the auto sync is off but they keep showing up in my phone book.n know im sing out of Facebook cause i removed it from the list in my phone of accounts to sync.i sing back it.the show up again. This is bull.bad update why do u have to keep updating it anyway. Stupid.
I use to love using Facebook, but now I can't even go in to the app with out it adding people into my contacts.  So sick of facebook.
My pictures don't show up.
Mubarak
TBH IT WONT LET ME INSTALL FACEBOOK ONTO MY PHONE AGAIN:/ I TRYED CLICKING ON IT AND THE SCREEN WAS WHITE! THIS NEEDS TO BE SORTED...ALSO KEEPS SHUTTING HALF WAY THROUGH OF DOING SOMETHING ON FACEBOOK!!!!!!
Cant search through your friends friends list ut makes it hard to find some people
With help of this my phone   gets latest app
Miguel barillas
Cool app
Sucks.
Good!!
Top
I prefer to have the old version...because for me its more faster than this one...delayed notifications and the time one was active on chat was also unreliable...
Love's facebook! #1  ;-)
Thamil
Force closes every 2 to 5 minutes. What the hell
Download app because not install
No different 
omgsh i like the internet fb update fb to the internet way thats nice
I don't want messager app to follow my life
Loved it I cant say any thing more than I lived it foever and all ways
App is designed at a good way
Consumes great mb space though
P
Facebook is very funy. I like Facebook
Luck is everything LiveLaughLove
Ok
It keeps kicking me out
Awesome but it laggs
The app constantly forces close...every day!!! Fix it
Won't load or takes forever to load pictures on news feed :-( please fix!
So bad in huwavi
Recent update has completely fu*ked up this app. Constant crashing and loss of connection. Why mess up a good thing with a sh*t update
Ads, crapware, spyware, lags, crashes. Maybe key logging.
Was working fine for weeks now it doesn't even open tried uninstalling the reinstalling still not working please fix: update now working perfect
Facebook
This new app is so slow and keeps freezing! Its by far the worst update Facebook has ever done! I have messaged fb and reported bugs but still no change! Please save yourself the hassle and wait for the next update!

Facebook
Fh shhh usury t f
Can't ever get off of Facebook it is so addicting!!!!!!! :-)
Still breaking boys off:)
If the notifications icon would ever actually go away, I DON'T WANT TO DOWNLOAD YOU'RE MESSENGER APP!!!!!!!   Oh, and after all the updates its still buggy and all but useless.
It's so annoying that you can only see top stories on your news feed. I would like it a lot more if you had the option to choose between most recent and top stories.
Great. Keep up on the improvements.
This app is like a big world for intertaining for me and everybody
It's OK need work, not so good since the last update
Won't log back in after crash. Says error loading news feeds. Been this way for 2 months now. Do your job & fix the issue!
Boring!!!
Like you bitches don't care
killer
Much  much  good
no
Thanks
Closes randomly, when I finish watching a video or post it takes me back to the beginning, hate it!!!!! Also closes out completely and I am getting very irritated with it, maybe it is not meant for tablets, I don't know but I am really tired of this,  I guess no more fb on my tablet!!!!!! Tried to reinstall but still no changes, grrrrr!!!
The app is indeed a headache
Error when playing videos. Kinda sucks!
With the latest version update my app refuses to open. Unuseable at this point.
I love fb
For mist of the updates videos are getting very worse and worse first they play then cut off half way though or just won't load at all big issue Facebook I know your more then capable to sort this out
Its so slow and bad..... its hunging my cell phone
Why is it aloud to record video and audio? And take pics?? This app can be better. And the messenger app sucks.
Nie
Facebook
bstp
It is cooooooool!!!!! LOL LOL
Wow
I love facebook
Love keeping in touch with friends and family.
Very Samsung is old model
Slow
Nice apps.
Very poor programmed. The conditions of service are not fair, bring the private information to anyone who want.
Since ive had update for galaxy tab 3 crashes all the time very annoying
Why move the messages to another app?? The mobile site is intact of that so why the hell the more advanced app can't be the same? Stop stalking people and their information. And the app itself crashes to often and doesn't log you out properly.
It's ridiculous, they now make you download the messenger so the fags can watch over you, also with fb new update, causes tons of problems, won't open up, forces things to close, won't let you into other apps, I say you retards need to hit the drawing board and either get rid of Facebook or find a new way
pains of a maid
Liked it
After my tablet updated to Android 4.4.2 FB continually crashes whenever I want to comment, watch a video or look at someone's profile.  Please fix.....
It's alright, it's a bit slow and the chat app is really annoying. If you can make the emoticon things for chat why can you not make them an option for a status?? Or on comments?
yeko.ko.7524
Takes way too long to load. Also the size is enormous.... Will give it 4 if it can be moved to sd card.

Since the new update, it freezes all the time. Please fix this.

Never open the app today and it sucked 38 percent of my battery and killed it in 6 hours
It sucks. It won't let me get into the app. It crashes all the time I open it.
It shows its capable for htc explorer but its not working!
The new update keeps locking up  and after I play a game I have to restart because it won't let me back to my fb page. It's getting to be a big pain in the butt.
Facebook..i like it..
AWESOME GAME #MONEY
It didn't work for me sorry
I got one account that was hacked the other one I cant loh into says incorrect email
Kiss it
It doesn't open. Stocked in "Just a moment..." my device is samsung galaxy young. Please, fix it asap!
This app takes up an obnoxious amount of space. No way I'd install the messenger app on top of it.

Because the peppous don't know user.
I love the things you put on Facebook

Moves slow! Now syncs contacts even when you turn sync contacts off..  I don't want contacts synced to my phone.  They need to fix this...  I have tried to uninstall and reinstall but still syncs even though it's turned off..  Refuse to download messenger as well!
Good
Its not posting my statuses!! Fix and itll be 5 stars
Facebook News Feed keeps crashing.
When I select comment on a post it keeps dropping back to the home screen on my Galaxy Tab3. Tried uninstall and reinstall but no improvement.
Nice
Horrible gir Samsung Tab3 since kitkat update..unusable
Won't load news feed images!!!
automatically syncs my contacts to my phone and I really don't want all them on my contacts list! I tried going onto setting to stop the syncing but it automatically does it again! Please sort it out
76.69mb? Really?
Everyone is leaving and deleting their FaceBook accounts and moving to tumblr  which is a lot better. MySpace fell apart, Circle and now FourSquare is going that same direction. So why am I going to stay when everyone I know is leaving Facebook.
Great...
Poor signal but it is amazing thank you who make this facebook app
Nobody cares about privacy here.  Forced me to change my real name to a fake one,  while so many others have ridiculous names. Wtf Facebook?
I installed the latest update,and now the Facebook app refuses to open.  Fix please!
Yu pamoja nasi
Im deleting this app because the programmers do not know what they are doing. This app forced me to delete a lot of stuff and it slows my other apps. I'm deleting it

We shouldn't have to download messenger just to message people also we need to be able to edit our comments and at times it does crash
I cannot swipe full screen photos left right with the latest version.

Not logging now but images does not load immediately even though I have faster connection

Samsung Galaxy Tab3. Can't do anything at all without it crashing. So frustrating & totally useless. Your frequent  updates are making it worse. No problems with any other apps ... just Facebook. No issues on PC or Samsung phone.. just SG Tab 3. Fix it please!
Fix this please
How come after months of complaints in the comments section that Facebook still have not reinstated the Most Recent posts in main feed?
I Iove this app!               Marilyn Buskirk
It crashes alot and doesnt let me scroll my news feed properly it doednt show pictures all the time and verg frustrating that you have to have messenger seperately
If i could give it a zero i would. The recent update has slowed my phone down, trying to scroll up & down is irritating and i get off facebook as quickly as i can. Then the app decides to close. Please fix it.
My book, my face...

If you haven't heard just about every other app you use can access the same things FB wants to ask so it's nothing new.
1-Group the (comment replies) in posts  2-attach files in messages                         3- the new thing (save) ..its not work with posts !!! Just for pages                               4-turnoff notification is not working by this app

I love  my facebook
This update means it now crashes on my phone often and doesn't work well
It takes forever or turns off I cant get in
Always Crashes When I Updated My OS to KitKat
Why does my Facebook keep closing
U have to download that messenger   and from that they can spy on you from your front camera be careful what you do or speak your phone + they can hack your account
After doing the update it locks up my phone or it sometimes takes to long to open. Keeps signing me out as well. Plz fix

It's getting really bad. The games run slow if you can even get logged in.

Needs updating.... And made faster.
Facebook
Facebook causes my phone's cpu to overheat. Htc One M7. And they try to force you to download their messenger app by disabling messaging from the core app so they can spy on you. Everybody delete and downrate. We can vote with our lack of use of the app. And then this illegal s hit can be reversed.
Social Auxiliary Work
Lover
This update made my Tab 3 useless to view FB. Seems like every couple of updates and they screw it up. They are too busy trying to spy on us than to develop a user friendly app. Use your browser instead of this crap.
loved it
O.k.
Users should now DOWNLOAD "APP OPS STARTER" for free that way they can override facebooks permissions to read contacts, otherwise if you disable sync facebook re-enables it on its own!!!!!!

Forcing my device to auto Sync contacts is all I need to delete this app.

Won't load half the time. Fix the fuckin app.

Did not think it would be possible, but the latest 'update' has made it worse. Wont load for more than 5 seconds before crashing, if it loads at all. (Galaxy tab 3).  Without doubt the worst app i have ever experienced for reliability. Complete crap.
I previously gave it 5 stars, but the app constantly crashes on my samsung tab!
Good
Best app in day world
It's a lot better with the new Ui

This app keeps crashing when i click on friends posts, when trying to see my own homepage or friends homepage. Uninstalled & reinstalled and its still not working.
No way do I now or ever give u permission to access my pictures or anything els on my phone to spy on me with your messenger app think, are you all peados
It's closing my music app everytime it updates. I can't listen to music and be on FB at the same time because it keeps closing -.-
Loved it
If you like being able to 'EXPORT' FB events to your Google Calendar, the app still doesn't support it for some reason. It's kind of a no-brainer. I'm not sure why they haven't included this really useful feature as of yet.   I shouldn't have to visit the desktop site in order to do this.
Awesome

My videos won't work now because of the few recent updates.
doan duy tan gall704.com
Love it I get to know my family a lot more
New updates suck.
Since the last update, it'll continously run as an active application. You have to physically go into your active applications & clear it out or it'll drain the hell out of your battery. Please fix this ASAP!
does not warrant any star rating. Since latest updates takes ages to load and most recent news feed takes too long to appear. Going to uninstall and revert back to using browser
This app is bullshit it takes over an hour to finish Loading... FIX THIS then i rate 5 stars
Love it.

Uninstalled this app and just login via my Web browser.

Hello every one here ....
I am now required to  have messenger installed on my phone in order to view msgs ob my facebook app. These are 2 separate apps that both take up space. Viewing msgs on the facebook app suffices w/o any further need for convenience. I wish to uninstall messenger but cant or I wont see any new msgs. Bad facebook! This needs fixing now
Vare good
Good to hang out with friends
Messenging functionality removed and replaced with ad for ap.   Also. Report post (spam) no longer works.
Apart from a few glitches here n der... Its nyc!

Uninstalling in 48 hrs if I cannot use my inbox with the app. I refuse to download messenger. Fix it or I uninstall facebook alltogether. This is nonsense.
The Best
This new update sucks! Making it a must that you download the messenger is total BS.
Sync to your contact
After updating messenger and facebook it takes too long to start (5 minites at least) and then it crashes quickly... 4.0.4
very nice

Yes
Gud but it's essential to have download manager for videos...... Otherwise it's ok

Why can't make Facebook simpler like it used to be where you can check your message on the same page. With this annoying messenger you have to log in to 2 seperate apps meaning i have to log out both of them when I'm done. Sucks!
Very bad
Amazing

USELESS!

Use to be fun until all the changes were made to it!! Now, you have to use messenger to get a message which is not fair because you have to allow them to put Spyware on your phone, therefore,  I don't even use it!!!
Amazing.....

This is not a good experience, now it takes twice as many gestures to unlock my phone.

I can not share a picture or a video received on other apps like Whatsapp to my pages on Facebook. Same for the pictures or videos in my gallery. Need an option that can allow users to share pictures or videos directly on pages on Facebook.
Fantastic

News feed is out of order. It shows you what facebook wants you to see.  And all jumbled up with stuff a week old showing up more recent than posts an hour old. It should show you everything in chronological order. Also tired of being sent requests to play stupid games!
Thanks
Still isnt optimized well for phones with low ram. Sudden forced closing. Lags a lot if used together with messanger.
OK
.
Acceptable!
Crashes soon as I open. Fix soon
Will not work for anything
Could be better
Cant look at yur most recent post
Fb you went beyond nosy by linking my contacts without permission, google you are beyond your limits connecting e-mails on every device. Government? Shame on you, nothing to hide but still doesn't give you the right. Smh
Nice
Draining battery life very fast
Works well. Minor issues with status and share.
Easy to use kept me connected when my computer gave up the ghost
Eats too much internal memory and it forces us to download fb messenger crap.
Five stars.
Best
Easy to be with loving and kind
My contacts sync automatically when I do not want them to. Every time I turn my phone off and on it syncs all over again. You are bullying us into having our contacts sync and that's BS. Remove this if you still want your app used. It's annoying!
Facebook r very good for communication easily that's I like it...
Crisp & clean layout, but the design teeters too far into "too stark". As for the whole "Top Stories" debacle: Most Recent is in the right-side menu under your groups, but it's sadly only session-to-session.
If it'd stop crashing every time I tried to share something or go to a friend's profile, that'd be great.
I want to cancel my Facebook account and start a new one because I for got password got new one from Facebook but still didn't work. I want it wiped clean so I can start over. I can't use my email address for a new account because I can't seem to close the old one. Awww someone help me.
Y is it giving problems pls
I love is app
Its speed has become veeeryyy slow after d latest update... n its crashing alot... plz fix it
Very good
It's all a bit intrusive.
Good keeping up with friends

What the heck is wrong with this update. Photos are taking forever to load. Takes too much space on device.

tired of constant telling me to download messenger. if i wanted it i would download it and if forced to download it I'll remove the app

Please fix it.. sudden crash on news feed comment like message after i update my samsung tab3 to latest firmware..
This is good app which is very helpful in using social site fb ...but add additional option night mode in it..!! It is very very difficult to use it at night due to its milky background...!! It affect eyes to a great way! :-)

New up date auto syncs contacts even if you choose for the app not to. I do not wish for my contacts to be synced. I will not be using this app until there is an update that changes this
This app hangs a million times
very good
Its OK but has a lot of flaws! Definitely prefer the desktop version. Not all info comes through on this app but does on the desktop version. I'll refresh my screen, and it will show new info from 4 days ago that never appeared. AND sometimes I share things so I can go back to them, Like a recipe I want for dinner one night, and its gone! Rrrrrrrrrr!
Very helpful
Vre
Perfect. ..
Have to switch phone off before latest update will log off. Improvement for speed? I don't think so!
No control over news feed - bring back Recent as I don't need your algorithms curating some Top Stories list.
i love the internet cuz there is thing named facebook
This is a version that  should be the "down"date but not update
Time pass+most thing

Thanks

Every since I installed the update all if my fb friend's are now synched to my contact list even though I have everything set to NOT synch...deleting this app until you fix it!
Since the last updates pictures takes awful lot f time to load or they wont load anyway...This problem was there in the previous ones too..  Please fix it .. !!!
Always getting error loading page while using WiFi...
Good App

My Facebook is currently updating and it is stuck at 4% even if I have a good connection. My cousin told me not to update mine coz it really became worse even with good connection. Please have it fixed... :(
I wish there was a setting to keep your feed only on Most Recent. Sucks having to switch back to it over and over.
Here is the application for facebook. It working good.. I am nothing to feeling bad.

Plz add video downloading options
Awesome
It won't let me view my notifications.
Fire the whole team who makes this app
App was great until last upgrade. Now every time I share a post an add pops up and the app crashes when I try to close the add.
New update has frequent hangs and crashes.
If the News feed is created by Mr then why can't I order it the way I want and no just see what my friends are liking. Bring back the most recent selection for viewing the news feed.
I love this app

too many bugs. couldnt log in and crashes my phone. the older app before the updates it worked. now its a pos. messenger works but ur app doesnt. wont reinstall till its fixed and works.
The app will not stay open for me. If i try to open a link, share a post, or review the notifications,  the app closes. It will also jump to the top of the news feed at random intervals. How can i look at everything if it won't let me get pass the first few post? This has only been happening since the last two update.
I like it.
Nice job

Since the update most recent now doesn't allow me to switch between notifications and my news view easily. (Most recent, obviously since that's the only one that makes sense) I have to exit my news view to see notifications. The prior version didn't have this bug.

Won't load,constantly sticking,freezing and crashing! I've stopped being alerted to any new notifications so if I don't leave the app 'open' I miss stuff. The newsfeed is 'all over' the place-not in time order so i'll be scrolling and seeing a jumble of recent stuff then things from 2/3 days ago. Oh,and i've been forced to have fb messenger which is also shockingly slow and crashes in the midst of typing msgs :-(

I'm having difficulty wenever I connect in my wifi here in my fone....its so slow....
Try it??
A lot of problems with this crap app. Needs a lot more work. My biggest problem with it being is in my news feed, it'll show statuses that happened a week ago. It is never up to date. I'll like and comment on statuses and half the time it won't even show that I liked it! It won't let you save pictures you click on. It won't let you share posts to your friends wall it HAS to be shared to your timeline. It will randomly glitch and I'll have to restart my phone.
Since this last update it always says error loading, I have Internet connection.. I hope you guys fix this soon.

Takes up way too much space, not optional nor usb transferable, mesgs out of order & don't always send properly...can't open many images that others post or upload...blocks other app usage when not updated, i.e. iHeartRadio...please make more user friendly & quick browsing as most use on the go, more users r mobile on FB @ any point in time rather than having the time to sit @ a computer which I kno is FB's aim to keep u on as long as possible thru the day...the mobile app is limited to encourage PC usage
Best for android phones.

Do not download messenger
Droid Maxx - Newest app update makes FB app constantly flash between gray and black screen. Worst bug I have seen on an update yet.
but we should be allowed  to see others & archived messages through this app. a option to show hidden posts should be added. and when other users tags us in their statutes, we are unable to remove us from that tagged post. so please work on these respects

You have messed this app up beyond belief. It used to work great, but now on my LG G3 nothing loads. It takes like ten minutes to load pics in my news feed, if they load at all. And video, forget it! I looked for other ways to access Facebook from my mobile, but apparently the official app is pretty much the only way, so if things don't improve fast I'm just going to get rid of your stupid app altogether. Get it together guys. Flagship phone and one of the fastest fiber optic internet, but pics won't load.

Ya gimana lg pake apa facebook nya ribet pake browser
Almost perfect. But still, laggy. Need more updates.

I totally loved it..
I don't like to give your app so extensive permissions, I don't trust you so much.
It's fast but takes much space on the phone.
Boring and slow when loading
Whats wrong with the "failed to load newsfeed"???
Posts don't post right ! Notifications don't display!

Supppppeeeeerrrr
love the new fb app, gr8 job

Excellent
I love this app.very much....
How about you's stop giving bans to people who aren't uploading pics containing nudity, rasism, etc. I have been banned twice now for a pic that was within fb protocol. I'm not happy at all.
Takes 3 dang years to logout of facebook...and I will have full service. That's the only thing wrong with Fb. Its costed me battery and data trying to log out and it wont.
Can't see pics, have to uninstall,then install again, arghh

Needs update. I have tried to like posts in both my mobile and my dad's mobile but results same,though I am taping on like but like is being rejected. Even problem in newsfeed.,its just showing pages suggestion. Kindly update this app.
When I use Facebook on my Samsung Galaxy tablet its always closing on me without warning. The only thing I can do on the app is read my News Feed. If I try to do anything else it just closes out and it's very frustrating. If this was fixed I'd definitely give 5 stars. I just uninstalled and reinstalled the app so I'm hoping that works!!
Better than other social networks. ....
The new update has caused automatic sync of contacts. I really do not need this, at all. As a lot of other users would not. When changing the option in App Settings to Do Not Sync Contacts, the setting changes back to Sync Contact Information when the app is re entered. Auto Sync is turned off in the Account Settings of the phone. Sort this out please.
6 hours loading it say sitting up Facebook then just a moment please fix this app
Love
Salae kutae bosdi walae nae banai hogi

Another change with the latest update where I can't look at news feed how I want. Harder to use, not easier. 10/10/2014 - still hate it. It's possible they do lots of updates so reviews look old.
New update sucks

Problem with logging out since the last update.
No comment
Love it
Unable play video in fb after updated...sigh
Nice
Crash a lot! It seems like home made app by an amateur. Whenever i click to like or comment it crashes. By the time Facebook decided to launch messenger separately i guess they only give attention to that now. Even then that app is also Rubish. Why would we prefer to use 2 apps for Facebook.
Why the hell it auto scrolls to the top each time i watch a video or enters a link... how about u read a paper with each time u finished an article u fuckin flip back to first page and start all over again... and tell me how u feel...

When I open Facebook the videos in newsfeed play automatically even I didn't tap it this makes my mobile freeze and I have to force stop the app plz I requested to solve the bug as fast as possible bcuz I cant live without fb
Just a quick question, does the recent update affects the blocked person to be automatically unblock? It happened to me after the update.
To miss friends
Dont like idea that someone is watching everything i do and from all the reviews I've seen I will visit from the website

Good. But can be improved when compared to the desktop  login features

Your picture is not large enough ...REALLY!  Every picture doesn't fit, urs has got to be the only computer on the planet not smart enough to make a picture fit in a space.
It does the job but it's pretty terrible. Just had to reinstall it as it wouldn't open anymore

No "share" in the option of every post..

For those of you that don't know, (on android anyway)  if you don't want messanger go to settings and delete your cache and info in the fb part of the settings. Then sign back in. You have to keep doing it but it's better then down loading messanger. Other wise just use your browser.
very nice app

Fasten the app a bit more and get 5 stars!
Well done
Why is this app go biger and biger mb?
It was really fantastic
I love to use facebook
Good
My Facebook app updated earlier today, and I have had to unsync my Facebook contacts from my phone 3 times. I DO NOT WANT THEM SYNCED! This is something that should be my option, not something that the app automatically does multiple times after I've told it not to. Please fix!
Loved
Great
No problem here but it use lots of data
Works fine, but it's kinda slow.
ME
Won't load up
Fascinating
Excellent!
No respect 4 MOBILE USERS! Nearly daily 25mb updates for poorer quality.  Daily? :-(
Its worst update
Useless for reading posts, only have it for sharing links as other facebook managers only post urls. I just want to be able to read most recent, as that is what keeps me coming back. Since this app doesn't allow that, I can't use it.
Amazing
Updated to latest version and still my notification tone does not work. Please fix!!!!
Its so annoying that you guys at Facebook removed the messages feature and forced us to install the Messenger app.
Good..
App is fast and can do multitasking also :)

This dumb app syncing my contacts without my permission. Whenever I turn the sync off and opening the app it automatically enables the sync and syncing my contacts.
Please make this app transfer all it data on my SD card but it only transfers 20 megabytes and leaves 105 which is a lot

Ever since the last update, the app never logs me in. Its mostly stuck on "setting up Facebook". Plz fix this.

I can't update my statuses. It's been pending posts all night I can't even share either
absolutly
Just a wonderful app
If you all haven't heard Facebook now makes you download messenger so the government an whoever else can spy on you this is giving access to people to watch you any time they can watch you through your front camera or back also listen to what you say through your microphone this is also used to help police bust people for several different things so think carefully an be safe with what you say or do having Facebook gives you 0% privacy also they can hack you an post ads or look through your message's
:)
Anything
Poor.

Amazing
I tried to update my old version of facebook but it used up too much memory and i can't open it. So I planned to uninstall it and reinstall it again and again but the same thing keeps happening. Please fix this and I'll give you five stars.
Expected better app from billion dollar company. Some functions lags behind. for eg. hide function. even after hiding posts it shows up again when I open the app. need better rating? then spend some money.
There is no reason why it should sync all of my friends onto my contacts. Futher more I shouldn't have to go onto the app settings and select the never sync option because the auto sync is selected automaticly. Anyone who is having this issue Facebook decided to make your life more complicated by having you open the app and go into its settings where you manage your notifications etc. You have to scroll all the way to the bottom where it says "Sync contacts" so that you can stop this bullshit.
More room for improvement.
Every Time I update my profile picture. I have to change my password!!!  WTF???
Update not good
Cant open facebook since thr last update. :_(
Fix it.. Hanging and auto force close..my phone. Memory usages is so high.

Facebook is just something else !!..It can be funny.Infuriating.amusing and Annoying..But knowing and using it is good fun.  = When I can get on it that is..Every 5 minutes I have to re~register the thing..Apart from that it's great !!.............

Hi..can you add like, comment and share options to photo album? When I went back the albums I created..there were no options to like or comment my album
Very nice
Its need messanger extra so this the bad thing
It keeps force closing since the new update and the newsfeed doesn't update right.
Keeps saying can't update news feed I have to disconnect wifi the reconnect. The screen updates and then same problem. Won't load any pictures or videos. Very poor. My connection is fine with all other apps.

Good
Can't put pictures up Facebook sucks
Getting worse by the days... Guess after the IPO, who cares...
Good
An update every time I restart my phone.  Really?? Your making myspace look good
Huge resource usage and you can't even see your messages without installing another app. About to uninstall.
ok
App "has stopped working" error way to often. Seems a very common problem on forums so hopefully you can resolve asap.
After launch it seems to freeze
No discernible reason to have this app use so much space and memory. I'd uninstall if it wasn't a built in app on my phone.
Getting better
Blocked my account for having cover photos which resemble my religion. Unethical, racist, against human rights... the app is good and getting better... but hate facebook... for app its 4 and half stars
Pahal bosan sangat ni?
His is a bloody joke facebook I had to uninstall all other apps to use the update I thought updates made it better not bigger and I am jot allowin facebook access to my contacts u can jog on
Bindas aap hai lakin  is ke aashik ban Jana of achi baat nahi ha
Every other time I try to log in saying there was an error, and I have excellent internet connection because I can get on any other website just fine. When I actually am allowed on Facebook, it freezes and shuts down. Very frustrating, please fix immediately.
Nice and convenient, but the most recent update causes my status updates and photos to fail uploading on the first try. If that's fixed, and we get custom post privacy (hide from specific people, not just everyone, friends, or only me), then my rating will go up.
Needs improvement
Can't copy the text...waste app
Plz add some extra features when u r upgrading ur software & plz add copy text option..

The Facebook app now is ok to use. Everything works fine.   But about the interface, It would be amazing if the interface is renewed.
Im loving it
The Android version is missing the option to edit your photos when posting them and for some reason you can only choose photos in your camera roll (not other albums) when posting a photo comment.
Won't open!! Keeps crashing!!
I hate the new update. I just uploaded a new video on fb. I've waited for 2 hrs just to see that my video disappeared? WTF !
Nice to use...

Used to work fine. Now crashes on start with Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 tablet. Please fix.
Why do you want to be able to read my texts and use my camera, read all my contacts?  Starting to lose its appeal if you carry on collecting information about users that you could use in a commercial way.
Its Good but keep updating ..

Very hard to see most recent news.
New update blows

Awesome application with awesome features
This app does not let you do chat, if you want so, then download another app (facebook messenger). What this app is of use if it can not do 100% of its job and force you to use another app for half of its job. Why are there 2 apps for a single work. Is there anything that they can't do with just single app, may be some tracking or user privacy breech kind of things that we keep hearing in news very often.
Works much better on Samsung
Its confusing at first but I caught on
Auto update and checks my phone for everything

Get your act together, someday there will a competitor and we will all be very happy to see this app crash,

Super

What type of feature you have added on this application. Every time I open this app it takes 10-15 minutes to open it and then crashes. From last couple of days I am unable to use Facebook. Fix this asap.

I can't share the post or status from this Facebook app. What's the problem is this?...please resolve this...
I am glad their is a Facebook. So I can keep in touch with my loving family.  Friends are good to.
super nice...
Can't post statuses. Can't post pic. Cant open anything. Its super frustrating.
Good
I personally do not like favebook messenger.  It tells everybody about the last time you were active on Facebook. There ate other privacy issues which needs to be set to protect the users.
superb tym pas
I hope I really enjoy
Can't watch videos anymore. Idk what you guys did but please fix it!
Hate to use 2 apps (messenger and this one)

i have tab 3 10.1 and every time i open any facebook page the app suddenly closes 
I hate it.
Okay but more improve
Grear
Overworked and still kicking
Facebook  keeps reminding me to install facebook messenger when i do not want to install it because it's wasting my memory.makes me more mad when it doesn't allow me to open and check messages in my inbox until i install it...
love
Good app..like it..running smooth on my phone
This app crashes within 5 minutes of opening it. Very frustrating
esto es mierda    I hate Facebook I do not like it es una basura
I just downloaded the new update and It crashes everytime I open the app. I can't do anything!
Good
Plz koi to btao ke ye downlod kese hoga
FACEBOOK WANTS PERMISSION FOR EVERYTHING!!
Similar to other app.but  tumbs up to fb.
I tey to used app nut good
Still it eat too much memory, it keeps running in process with a huge number of RAM.. sigh..
Hey guys u made such a nice app and u gave a slot for msgs nd now u r saying that I have to download another app for that .this is not so nice pls fix it jst make one app for everything
I'm getting to bored with facebook. When im going to open it's hangging. Let me do some favor. Before you upgrading facebook, let us known from email send us your new description.
I try to post or like something or even comment and it drops off it is very irritating very irritating
This version is not good because it can't show the pictures
Perfect for connecting with new friends,old friends,and the occasional,used to be friends. Lol! ;)
It keeps synchronizing the phone numbers from my friends in Facebook even thought I didn't let it, i choose the option erase and don't sync but keeps doing it!
I really miss being able to see the most recent stories and seeing things from ALL of my friends, not just the ones with the most comments or likes.
Aku insan yang sangat malang di dunia ini.. Aku tak dapat tunai kan hasrat untuk bersama nye kerana aku orang miskin yang tak mempunyai harta dan wang ringgit..

Problem loading the other videos since I updated this app yesterday. Please fix.
Nice

Good but resource hog
So-So
Use everryday...!
Good Application and fixes.
Good one
Please make fb to install in sd card. Updates are very bad & app is force close issue & very heavy app for mobile after update its taking too much space in phone memory near 57 mb thats very irritating. Make this to install in sd card and fix the force d then i will give 5 star.
Likeit
Worst,,useless,,always stop,
I HATE FB!!! I UNINSTALLED FB. YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW WHO IS IN MY CONTACTS!!! YOU DO NOT NEED TO MY LOCATION!!! AMONG OTHER THINGS!!!HATE FB!!! HATE FB!!!
Git trip off
Love it
Could be better.
So happy
With phones providing just 1g.b app installation space, fb and its messenger takes more than 100m.b for installation and data,we wont be left with space for other apps.. Fix that..
Why do they need to access my microphone?
T
Good
Amazing!!!!
Social network  very use full but depends up on the user
New version
The app won't open.. Plus updates takes up so much space..
I will delete FB on my tablet. It has been years and FB does not optimize the app for the Android tablet experience like Google+ does. Google+ is gorgeous compared to the junk FB tablet app. All the apps I use are optimized for the tablet, except FB.
I have to go into the menu to get most recent. It won't sync contacts either.
The best

Old version was better. This version showing old posts everytime. Not showing new statusupdates.
good

This is not download on samsung galaxy q t589
Great
It wont let me post a status on a galaxy note ll... fix it. The app was alright until the update...
Awesome :)
CAUSE & EFFECTS OF DOPE A$$ MUSIC... CHI HEART...
Crash
Facebook App was a shame before. Now with the native version they have improved a lot as they did on iOS. FB app still missing small things like in the web you can such as: -Edit Comments -Delete Comments -Unsubscribe from a topic or page. But those things can be improved with small updates. Also Images are still loading too slow or not loading at all.
At working in real life
*919*
It keeps forcing close and try to open again it sets Facebook back up.  Since the update it has done this.  I am very upset
New update runs app in foreground even when not displayed, uses GPS. Daily active usage was 15 hours GPS, and 9 hours active. These are nowhere near accurate. But my droid maxx has been dying this week in a single day, while last week I'd be at half charged.
Cool
It's ok
Love it
Gaahhh!! Every update it's something worse, I hate the new timeline, and now when I try to post a status update, it will not post, says loading... Forever....
oguffvynj
Multiple Account support like hangouts, gmail... And Please allow the app and data to be moved to external sd card... This app itself takes 60MB out of my 1GB internal memory...
Luv u
It won't let me uninstall. I don't want this app anymore because I don't want them having access to my camera & microphone and it won't let me uninstall. Not satisfied at all
Slllloooowwww
Getting better and better every update.
Awesome best thing ever made!!!!!!
Like
Just lags and freezes alot

Just Crap
The.. App its so bad so so bad this is closed only and  late much for charged bad bad bad...
Installed the update & can't get on FB now! Fix this & it will go back to 5 star rating!
The new update keeps freezing on my samsung tablet. Have uninstalled it and  installed again but still does it!! Help!!!
I definitely like the new U.I. but I wish it would let me change the settings and make my most recent stories the default like the older versions.
Don't waste your time and memory space.  The messager app is even worse
Every update is getting closer to a great operating system, keep it up you may reach 5 stars someday
5 star
love it
SassySue
is my hobby!
Ever since the latest update. ..Facebook dose not open. ..just crashes before it opens. ....
Way to get in touch with friends n family,ESP.love one.
Different problems with this app day to day. Can't sort posts the way I need, buttons disappear, not to mention there is NO way to contact anyone for support.
. Its glitchy. Like it freezes and you just can't do anything but stare at your phone and be like, why me? Like jesus send me an angel now to heal my app.
On xp: sp. I w8 4 d nxt update.
It's too good app i like it
Latest update cause the facebook app on my samsung tablet to crash constantly.
Hiding Recent Stories option for Timeline/News Feed is a big play for advertising.  Really sucks.  Using web view now. --1

Posts and comments
Always log!!!!
What hav u guys done at the new update? *hard to connect *loading take LONGER than ever before *where's the button of "Dislikes"???? not every comment is Always good to see. Can i have Zero rate for u now?
I like so,so much..
Everyone might wanna check out Myspace (by the way their android mobile app is in fact ready, performs better but lacking interesting pages to subscribed to). Or check out Ello when they are finally open for public. In the mean time the alternative is only Google+ which i cant say much any better than this thing. At least google+ mobile app perform a little better. Weibo should have been available in english.
I shouldn't have down low messger to talk with my friend i like it the way it was.
After i updated Facebook can no longer open. It crashes after update. I have uninstalled the crap called app.
Not good always force close insumsung galaxy pls check
Aaaaa
New update sucks...keeps crashing every time that i open the app!
App
It kicks me off alot...What, you don't like me...
Good
Good

Since I updated the app I can't open any link in my Facebook, I thought it could be a web browser problem, but I tried using my email and another app and it worked. So fix the problem as soon as u can

LOVE IT!

Why am I seeing updates from two days ago it's fucked is this sort it out ya bellend

Why is this so resource intensive
:) :)
Did the new update on my Samsung tab and every time I click on FB the application crashes.   Have uninstalled then reinstalled, rebooted but no luck.   Will consider changing  rating once bugs are fixed.
If I could put a zero I would. Every other app on my device works perfectly except for this one. Facebook kicks me out everytime I try to update a status or check out a friends page. I can do nothing constructive on this app, if anything about FB is constructive. I have to use my desktop version to do anything to my account. Don't get me started on FB Messenger... Ugh and Yuck!
Lill mama
This app crashes on my Galaxy Tab everytime I click on ANYTHING!! Crashes on photos, going to friends profile wall, on any link. Fix this and I will change my review.
Nice one also supports other languages.
Problem with installation for Sony Experia E1 dual update kitkat. Please tix it. . Thwnk you. !

Ever since Samsung updated the tab 3, facebook is one of 2 apps that shut down every time I click on something. New page, comments, pictures. EVERYTHING. I'm done. You can have it back.
Facebook is taking lots of time to open. Its way too slow.previous version was much better.
Prblms..prblmss..prblmss.... Aftr the last update my phone crashed 3 times and the app is too slow...
Good
jelly
good

But too many updates
Don't work
Awesome but how do i put my profile on google search
Enjoy Facebook fot connection with my family a d friends a new ones.
Facebook is the devil
U can.be.who.u want
When I update the app. It can`t open and must force to close it
Facebook
Sick and tired of the constant updates to "improve" this app. The only thing they seem to care about is the ease with which Facebook is able to gather data about us to sell us things. Browser version is even worse. Messenger app is a watste of memory and data.
I'll be glad when they get it together. Too many updates. Taking up all my memory on my note2
To bad bcz it take long time to downloading
Many options that are available when you visit Facebook over desktop/laptop ate not available for Mobile app. App is highly disabled.
I like all of the app here in to play store
Love it
I love hearing from people who i have not talked too our seen in years

I can say what i feel
Ok,do Not like the New Version! It has it's good & bad,but the older version was much better,reason beingnis we. didn't have to Sync,which 99% of us Hate! TMI ...
The hell is happening to earth?  a facebook app without a COPY & PASTE feature in comment.  I think this should be done immediately.  instead of copying the text and paste it on, now i use to screen shot the comment for my friend to see it.
Loved it
Better
It's ok
I like Facebook, but I get notifications for EVERYTHING. People post pictures I'm not tagged in: notification. People I'm friends with comment on a random picture (not mine) notification. Very annoying
What subject says
Fix them facebook is now useless because ya cant do anything without the app shutting down.... surely you've had millions of complaints by now...... are ur tech staff even working?
NW awesome
Its facebook. The only app to use when you wany to fb
Always hanging up just because it has eating much memory on my phone. From 18.96 MB going to 50.96MB
I has tp tajke up all my space
Great I love it.

Takes up so much memory won't let me open it
Social media way to keep up with family and friends
I have to log out my I'd for 3 times on my Sony. Pls set this problem
It coo
I can talk to people
Its not too good it sometimes hang.
Very Good but less privacy and facebook messenger should add with this app.
Very good
How pathetic ...
There are some bugs n freeze points tht need to b fixed this gets done ill rate a 5 slow to download and really big
?
All over good.....
Face book
I am using these appp.... very nice apppp....but some lacks in this app.....that have to improve....like copy+paste
Love the game
Easy to use fast and effective
I hate that i have to update facebook every two weeks and takes up so much space Thats why i give it a two stars
Its a heavy app for a phone with 4 gb storage.
Pls fix this issue, only been doing this since last update.  Very frustrating.  Fix pls.
Cant complain i like this app
Love it
I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still nothing! It is highly frustrating! It was up until I updated and now the Facebook screen pops up n then black! Sets me back to my home screen. Please fix
Excellent
Good

My news feed completely sucks. I have hundreds of page likes and hundreds of friends, yet I keep seeing the same stuff from 6 hours ago that I could care less about. Including local yard sale pages. Facebook mobile sucks.
I'm happy to vote it no star.  1. It's nonsense to get a messenger which can be embedded in fb. 2. It's  even stupid that fb app doesn't work after I was forced to install the messenger, neither the messenger. (Nexus 5 under Art)
nice
App keeps shutting down when I try to post, like or share on my Samsung tablet...very annoying!
Let's me up with all of my friends, real nice Application!
Edit my comments or delete grrrr
EVERYDAY UPDATE REALLY ANNOYS ME , 155 MB IS WAY TOO BIG AND IT KEEPS OVERHEATING MY PHONE !!! UPDATING BUT NOTHINGS CHANGED , I PREFER TO USE MY BROWSER INSTEAD OF THIS CRAP !
Needs to be able to show recent stories instead of top stories
Love..it
Great
Love face book.... But we should get to vote on what updates we want.  Some not so good.  Others OK.
high speed no drag...
Like it

No more restricted option! Why?
Good
Sexy
It lags and shuts down a lot
Loading pictures are so difficult since last update
Your app sucks balls.
I have more than 10000 photos in my scynced photos I want to delete them but it asked to mark 1 by 1 it will take too much time and effort . How I can delete them all once and for ever? Please help . I use Samsung s4 Mobile Phone
I'm sick of it forcing me to update even though I keep turning auto update off. All it's going to take is one law suit for these ridiculous invasions of privacy to blow up and back fire on them. Facebook will die for the same reasons MySpace did. I'm switching over to Oovoo, twitter and Skype.
Itz good but very slow n search
It's pretty good except for needing to use the Web app to check messages. I don't want another messaging app.
Need fix some partpart.
Basic features are missing from app like copy text. If you see a good status message which you wanna copy instead of share you can't do it as app does not support basic feature of select and copy.
Good
Should have six stars
Everytime I open it up it force closes itself and sometimes it even reboots my tablet. Galaxy tab 3. Running latest update
Beauty
Of coarse first it was the most recent unable to set default.. then its the very legal problem with contact syncing and now it wont even open. Great job guys great job
D ont change phhone num ng ers or forget your password. Facebook is awesome fun lots of   information fun facts anrd a ton of bs. You just got shift and strain the best part to make a real fun time
Lousy.  Keeps forcing close
It don't use my internet or anything i luv it!
Yucky app i got cancer from it
The worst thing I have seen in my life is this. I will advise all users to delete this horrible app from your mobile.  Waste!  Waste!  Waste!
The newest update keeps crashing when I try opening the app. It is annoying and time wasting. Do something about it or people will turn away from it.
Worst update ever!
Uploading is too slow now with video upload.
Hey Facebook! Where are comment replies and other features iOS has?
This app is crap you can't view your messages you every time I like something it unlike it p.o.s app use your Web browser it's faster and better and you can view your messages and send messages without the messaging app
Yay got
What's wrong
I'm disappointed about needing to install messenger. And it showed me all the information you need access to, no thanks.
...good
Please fix the fact that every time I load up Facebook it syncs my friends to my contacts in my phone. SUPER ANNOYING.  I can change the setting over and over and it still syncs. Ready to delete the app
suddenly all the smileys have vanished. I can't find them when writing comments using blu studio 5.5s phone
roselovelygirl
Shuts down on samsung tablet
Cool
Needs a new update the app keeps crashing on me.
Samsung galaxy tab 3. Randomly closes.
Bommmmm
Not bad
It's a very slow app .. images don't appear or appear after a century .. scrolling always lags .. slow slow slow slow slow slow
You can have four stars if you fix the bug that's killing the app process... It's random but mainly when looking at friends list.
Unable to play any video, after clicking on video app getting freezes for some time and then getting close automatically. Pls fix this bug asap. Still having this problem even after so many updates released by Facebook team. Really disappointed. Device in use is Micromax Canvas 4.
its clashing...
This updated version is a slug lancher. And when i touch the pop notifyer, also doesnt launch.. I more likely to have the older one but i have no choice
I should download MESSENGER to replay message
Yashpalrawat
The Fb is used become a lot of friends..
The ram usage getting high and high with new update.
Have nothing to say. They did a great job for this mobile app.
Nice
The latest update of this app stinks! Everytime I try to comment on a status or post a status update, it bumps me out and closes the app. This needs to be fixed!
Nice! Droid
WTF? STOP AUTO SYNCING TO MY CONTACTS!
Stop syncing my contacts... It's annoying fix it please
Is the best forever you now........
Nice
There is a post by him that is in my notifications, there has been over 200 comments to this post and is driving me crazy.  Can you remove it PLEASE!!! Thanks.  Would also like it if we could delete the "people you might know", if I wanted new friends I would go to "find friends".
Who and what I need to find yes! !!

ISS
Why I can't Install it?
I like to use it

There's no way to post on anyone's wall the write post tab is gone!!????

Pesado
I lovet because you can find your friends
I LOVE THIS
It was fine when it first started now people started posting the dumest things on it.
As of the October 9 update the Facebook app still does the "setting up" thing everytime you try to open it. Obviously, someone broke the app after version 17. You had one job!!!
Facebook
But it is installing very slowly
Easy to use and installation was a breeze.
Now its more easier
Good
you made an update and nothing happened still saying JUST A MOMENT.
Very great app
The button like does not work.
Its old and slow
The newest update sucks and wont work on my phone its ridiculous and I'm getting rid of it. Stupid POS!!!!!! STOP WITH THE USELESS UPDATES AND MAYBE I'LL PUT IT BACK ON.
u need to fix these things 1- Setting "most recent" as a default option 2- showing preview of the link before sending it in message or posting it (like pc version) 3- setting a pic from the profile pics album as a profile pic without having to crop it and making a new copy of it!!
This is a amazing app
Facebook

Love it
Facebook messenger
I love it p

How can get the oldr version back?!

Most of the times have to use my browser to use some options on my phone and is annoying having the extra app
After the update,it crashes instantly.

Sound notifications can be improved, force close error is a big headache especially when middle of something !
Nice app
Facebook
Software
Galaxy Tab 3 10.1: Not working. Crashes all the time. Unusable app.
FaceBook
The app slows down the phone and constantly crashes. On my new phone. On my tablets. Only safe place seems to be on the Internet. Very disappointed as it was never like this.
The app will not stop syncing my contacts even after going to settings and hitting "do not sync". I am about to delete the app.
Facebook
To slow now
FB app crashing at random times/functions for last 4-5 weeks. Everything up-to-date, samsung galaxy wifi only tablet. Have reinstalled fb 3 times, most recent after complete restore of tablet :/ everything else works great.  Anyone else having this problem? Any fix suggestions?  - update 10/09/14 - crashes/shuts down constantly !
Off the chain. I mean off the hook
Facebook is facebook and it will always be facebook.
Can't open anything up, it just shuts right down... please fix this!
This sucks why the he'll do I have to download your crappy messenger app, so you can go through my stuff? Screw that I'll give to kik or something
This app sucks
Won't allow me to download app since i've downloaded messanger .
It won't let me finish something i am reading it will go to the top of the page
Good servis
i caant plaaay videos !!!
Unless on wifi or in google chrome on my phone. Facebook wont work. App stinks
I do not like that in this version of facebook i am unable to choose which friends can and cannot see my posts. I am unable to individualy select friends unlike the iphones version. Have i gotten my settings wrong or is this just a feature samsung doesnt have?
Thanks Mark Z.
Love it...
I think I

it's a great way to cummcate  with friends
People can see and read your messages
Im not sure what you did but I cant even log on anymore! As soon as I open the app it uses so much memory that it tells me I have to clear space to use it! This is after the last update! It doesnt even take me to the log in screen!
Needs Improvements
Use lot of memory please fix
Love it
But please do not force us to use facebook messenger!
Let me play my games with my Facebook Friends Thank you
its ok
Ready to work
Is one of my favorite apps
I want my news feed default to "most recent" not "top stories". I always change it everytime i open app, and that's annoying. Please fix this.
Nice app and easy to use
I got this and I got connected with all my freainds
I can talk to pep I want the other updates
IT CRASHES EVERY TIME I OPEN FACEBOOK !! CAN'T EVEN GET ON IT !!! PLEASE FIX IT !!!   
There are no changes at all.
The app freezes randomly and my phone has to be restarted to function again.  So infuriating!
But always loading it's very late
Just keeps going round and round and doesnt display some pic.
I have a lot of family so it really helps
Even though I chose not to a hundred times it goes back to it... Wth!?
love it
I cant comment on a status without that big editing bubble coming up while I try to read the status.and why doesn't it say via Android when you post like the blackberry one.
Takes up way too much of my storage space.. slow loading at times and the update couldn't be downloaded. Got fed up with it I deleted it. Please fix it and I'll download it again one day. Thanks.
Ugh. So sick of this.
You talk to friends and more
argghhhh! Still don't have copy paste feature! Grow up, add it. :P
Not helpful at all  I don't know why....!
This is the most utter bull ever. I don't have my government name on here for a reason. I will just stick with instagram! First messenger now this. Yall can have fb cuz all these changes seem in favor of police fbi etc
Love this app
Good app
Facebook
Love it x100
Don't remember agreeing to FB to access my contacts. The first try was the FB message app and now they just go ahead and access my contact list just now in the update No thanks. Not sure how legal that was either
Im stuck on the "setting up facebook" and "just a moment" scene and then the app crashes. Please fix!
Very good..
Facebook Hacked Me ??? I Can't Log In & It keeps sending my Facebook friends messages saying Their accounts are going to be disabled !! Please Help Me Fix My Facebook .
Nice
We need the reply feature for comments .. We need loooots of improvements .. But still an amazing app truly .. Thank you facebook
Yes now it,s messenger! I want the soddin thing to operate to MY PARAMETERS (just so the geeks know what I mean!) I hate load and detest the app but what other way to keep in touch with the lads and lasses I spent the better years of my life? I give you the ROYAL NAVY circa 1975 to 1989.
Could there be a more annoying program to use? Especially one that tracks everything you do without you're knowledge or true acceptance
Its so slow and its taking too much of my internal memory ! 
no coment
I love facebook but it frezzes my phone sometimes
Photo organization is a joke.. The old u.I  was so much easier to navigate.. Stupid decision guys...
I love it!
Want my page back
Love it
StandardGear
The app randomly cuts out. I will be on for a few seconds and the the app turns off!! I cant even look at anything!! Please fix!!

Love Facebook. Awesome way to keep in touch with everyone.
Really
It's slow
Auto contact sync. Thanks a lot for messing up my address book!!
Only show the old news feed...so annoying when we update the app,it just turn to piece of junk.
Keeps crashing and getting boring now
I can't see a complete video
I look at Facebook every morning like a newspaper

Awsome
Duuuh. Amayzaying
I would really like if all of my friends stories will show up on my news feed, not just the top stories or stories from people I interact with the most.
Facebook repeatedly violates people's right to freedom of speech deleted their app and deactivated my account Facebook can go to Hell
Facebook a1
Why has this app not got the translation button like on the desktop site? Useless for reading friends posts who write in another language.
Why
Im lynn Reyes Married name.
Lol
Awesome
For an older version, can't log in ANYMORE!!!!!
J
I can't install this
Facebook is ok... People harass you alot.

Facebook
Nice n smooth
Facebook memang best.
So much better than the last one..  & faster
Crashes, slow loading, not good
What is up with Facebook. Why does it update to the first post so often without me wanting it to.  Terrible decision for the last update.
H.b.3
A
Good app.
Many issues lately. I still use it though because it's how I keep in touch with friends/family on a more regular basis.  Update: why in the hell does facebook think it needs to send out emails without my permission or knowledge?? (9/23): been having lots of issues past 2 days, keeps saying 'trouble loading news feed' but I'm on 4GLTE. Plz fix! Annoying to constantly have to reload app and still only see 1 post if I'm lucky! (10/9): I've sent 3 reports about the news feed and still NO RESPONSE OR FIX!!!!!!!!
Title says it all. Crashes all the time.
Everything loads perfectly! And so fast!  Love the new update!!! :)
Nice
I want to download video plz there is no option to download:-(
I love it
Wove it
Imran god nit

Very good app
Best app ever hands down lol i have no problem with it nice job ;)
Yall fucked up the way u view pics
Right
It was great until the latest update. Now it closes within seconds. Utterly useless. Uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled issue remains.
great
great app! ! would be nice if could use s5 fingerprint scanner to log in
Its the fastest
Facebook call results excellent
I don't have auto-refresh switched on... yet I will be some way down my timeline reading a post when suddenly Facebook decides I should be reading something else, removes the post, or sends me to the top of my timeline. Idiots.
Fb
Can't even get app to open account. The update just wasn't good at all and yeah, nobody likes it. Too much space needed and slow and awful. Fix this and I will fix rating. One reason why I got my iPhone 6.
Excelant
Likes it
Count on it
What have you done guys. Since latest update the sysyem constantly crashes and logs me out. Only way around this is by deleting and reinstalling app. Please fix asap 
is not working
The latest update is terrible! Won't open sometimes, force closes other times, freezes up, links don't open...I could go on and on...sigh!
Does not load anything and can't even log out getting mad
I cant download this app but i can download the messenger app
Keeps saying just a moment for over a hour...
I have a problem to install fb app with error 24, plz solve my problem. Thanks
Ali123
I can't even log to my account fix it .... I can't access my account
Its take 2 much time to open
Sometimes I press back key randomly and Facebook close itself. It would be great if it asks us to press back key twice to close the app! I'll give it 5 stars if u fix that!!!
Terrible took forever to download then read all the horrible comments and gave up. What's the point
Facebook is ok
Not able to get into app at all. Wish I had turned autoupdates off. When is it going to be sorted?????
Constantly shuts down at random times...so bad, I'm afraid to put comments on posts as it pop off in the middle...even the loading (trying to reload app to see if it helps) has shut this comment down three times...and the requirements... Don't like that listening or filming permission
I can't download fb
I has got slower to load up i will give you a 5 when you fix it
Greatest app ever
Too many privacy issue
salam
It's easy and inter resting time consuming
Yea
Fb
Xooolllll
Remove fb messenger it sucks!!!!
Why i didnt make  a call on fb and messenger!! Big problem to me!!
Luvit
when will be added video call and syn to contacts like Viber and skype
Good
I don't know what I did to be disabled.
Updated this and now it won't stay open.  Un installed and reinstalled and still doesn't work.  :(
So nice app like and give u 5star
I love face book  can contact family n friends
So my sister is has a huge situation with Facebook. She has done nothing wrong and only does things for people. But yet, her account has been disabled. What does that mean? Why is it disabled? What are you doing that has to be done and what was wrong with Facebook that had to be fix? Please go back to the way things were before everyone on FB is in this situation.
I think they should have left it as a page, not a timeline...but leave some things the same, for example...sharing people statuses, liking people comments, when they comment under a status, unlimited space for writing statuses and and saving old messages that's it
Very poor
I love Facebook
It just crashes all the time, sucks
I love hari
Thanks mr.mark I am totaly impresed with your idea of connecting world
...
Doesn't even let me open app any more several times throughout the day. Even after restarting my phone. Deleting
Splendid on N3
Its too much real to connect d people
Nothing loads on Wi-Fi. Not having a problem with other apps or internet when I'm on Wi-Fi, and FB works fine on 4G. What's up?
Face book closes 20 seconds after I open the app. Fix this problem an I will rate you 4 stars
This is good app
Efficient and good for on the fly reminders
Good
It was a good app
This app is verry good.I really loved it.

This is completely crap. I will uninstall the application soon and would recommend it to all my friends on Facebook
This is the 3rd time I'm installing this app! It keep crashing on me! If I wasn't so addicted I'd just delete and forget.
Update did not work. Can't open Facebook app. Goes to my browser right before crashing.

Most helpful place ever
Great to use to get in touch with people we knew in our pass and present. Keeps you up with what going on.
After logged in...its hangs phone for few seconds or minutes. ..and then starts...happened after update
Jangal
After i update this app, i cant open Facebook in 5p
FACEBOOK HAS HACKERS THEY STEAL YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION ETC. WEB OR APP. DO NOT GO TO IT. EVERY TIME I POST A STATUS IT DISAPPEARS. AND MY PHONE OR MINI LAPTOP ACTS STUPID LIKE SOMEONE HACKED IT!!! I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE HERE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TOO! Why is it that everytime i download this app there's always a virus in it? Says December 31st 1969.
It's great for me to get with people far removed.
After The Last Update It Crashes A Lot... Problems While Logging Out It Doesn't Log Out Properly N While Opening It Crashes... Waste Of Time... Kindly Fix This Problem...
Nice very
Lst update finished facebook!!!!
Need to make file smaller...no reason to have 70mb of space taken as soon as you open it.
I loved type is too much boring not good please change it into type
There has been some glitches & minor issues all along but after the lastest update it has become a real problem to use. If I click on 'to share' or 'comment' it says either 'post has been deleted' or 'not allowed'. Which is incorrect! Yet might allow later! It's very sluggish and skips when I'm in the middle of reading a post and goes to another post! Please fix! Newest update only seemed to make it worse if that's even possible! And seriously what is up with the chat?!
Looking for inbuilt browser :-(
I like it .
Very bad app
Your app is freezing when you select to message someone. And how come it doesn't automaticaly go to messenger it just decides to freeze up quite anoying can go on and on about it but just have to put up with it o i how about removing the icon for messaging all together since you cant use it. Use the messanger app icon instead that sends you strait to messenger just a thought
Why does links open in the browser instead of inside the app ???  And Just when I touch on the video, the app force closes
I loved it !
Love facebook
Title says it all
Useful app ,notifies me of every update on facebook. Uplaoding pics is fast and easy.
amazing

My FB does not load at all after this update
Runs faster but hate setup. Can't put pics in albums i want anymore!

Like father like son
Android version still SUCKS.
So slow
Like they said its just a waste of time.. please fix
Its take up too much phone memory everytime I update it. Even if I already installed in on my SD card but still it eats my phone memory.
Hi
I hate facebook all it is used for is to bring trouble to people,to add to a person's insecurity. You really find out what a player your husband Is on facebook. He doesn't want anyone to know he's married,and continues to add single  women to his friend list
Well this my device
Fun with buddies
My facebook app always crushed ever since I update this. Please fixed this immediately!
Won't let me turn off notifications from posts... And sick of game invites, ugh......
Si blocca sempre e mi riporta alla. Schermata di home nel tablet non lo fa sul cellulare ma io vorrei andasse bene sul tablet   importante...help allora cosa devo fare? La applicazione si scarica la memoria c   i giga li ho navigo. In quattro g ma su fb e solo quella fb questa versione tutto rallentato e dopo. Due operazioni mi riporta alla schermata del tablet volete aiutarmi o. No!!!!
Its good
Love this APS it puts me in touch with my family and close friends all around the world just like that
Every time I try to log in , it will never login
Since the last update it keeps crashing
Slow to send pic and video msg
Good
Thhanks
Love only
Slow...
Facebook
It is crashing
App is crashing in a minute... Have installed n removed hips of time
Wont work. Dnt knw why its so slow..... it takes more than a few minutes just to log in! It just crashes away mostly.
The app won't load any photos. I can't see my friends profile pictures in corner of their post, and I also can't see any of the pictures that show up in my news feed. Facebook needs to get their stuff together the last 3 updates I've had major problems with. The app ran like a champ about 4 updates ago, but ever since then I've had a lot of trouble with facebook.
Best aap
I gave 1 star bcoz i really really want to use this app but i realize why do i need to give star for a useless app.. Its very big and i cant use it properly can you fix the problem so i can give this 5 stars? Grrrr
Crashing randomly.
I will meet
Nice ...
Nice

Goooddddd
Works vd speed
Keep crashing every time I scroll pass a video now. Actually it force closes at least twice a day now since this update :/
keeps on crashing -.- I can't even open it anymore pls. fix it. I dont know how to uninstall its updates.
After this recent update, it force closes on me and always tell me its "setting up".  I'm close to uninstalling until you get this fixed.

Boht hi buri Facebook h yaar.. Speeed  0 zeeroooooooo h..
Keeps crashing and moves timeline to top whenever it feels like it
This last week, especially, there's been many hickups with this app. Stop messing with it. Just fix it. While I'm busy...why can't I copy and paste posts? Comments I can copy, but not posts. Very frustrating.
Many buggs should be fixed.very slow version.gets blank for some times
Siva
It keeps crashing! The most recent update ruined this app.... I'm about to say goodbye to Facebook all together if it's not fixed soon.
So so nice
Best social network ever

Thank you for listening us and adding reply option .
Amazing
Super
Super app

Can you guys make this process easier by when we upload picture by letting us choose from albums first instead of a camera roll. I do a lot of funny memes and its kind of tiresome to scroll and wait on pics to load just to know that I am no where near the pic I want

Too big once installed
What have u done wid this app..it is very very slow
Awesome app...loved it

Wow

After update wouldn't open
I just updated my facebook last night. I tried to go onto my facebook this morning but it keeps closing on me everytime. Please FIX this issue because I need facebook. My rating never changed because YOU facebook needs to fix this app fast and it needs to be okay to use.
Works everytime
Tried over 10times to correct passwrd kept telling invalid or  incorrect . Then was told I was miss treating or abuseing this app.  Quite annoying! !!!!
I have been using this application since many months now on Micromax canvas doodle 2 (A240)(Android version 4.2.1)..sorry to say but i never got a smooth experience....the application crashes if i try to watch videos....photos would not show....it would take forever for the photos to load...tried uninstalling and installing....nothing works....ugghhh...0 star if i could give

Soon after the last update dis fb app has become a flop... Mtchewww
Thank you Fb for finally giving my notes button back!!! It's been way too long. Please don't take it away!!! Rating changed!
I have to uninstall and reinstall it every day.  I thought my phone was the problem until I saw others were having the same issue.
Good
connection is so low... f^^^
Vz
What can I say its slow, freezes a ton, you can't get just the most recent posts , you can't check your messages anymore without getting a separate app which I refuse to do, seriously the new update is a piece of crap and I wish I could go back to the old one.
This app sucks since the new update! Keeps force closing. PLEASE FIX THIS!
P
This app is consistently the largest battery drain on my phone. Recently it has singlehandedly been responsible for a full 1/3 of battery use... while running in the background! I open it less than one a day. I feel it is unacceptable for any app to hog that many resources while not being used, and I am uninstalling this one.
I hope very fast loading, thanks
Love
Why does it take so much space and i cant even opeb it at all
This is a great great game I love to play
Fine
it does not work.correct it soon eats lotof ram.

Slowwwwww app :/
Just crap.

Ever since the last 2 updates, it constantly crashes. Every time I click on anything, it crashes. Can't click a link, video, photo, search or post anything without it closing. Been happening for over a month. On Galaxy Tab 3 10.1.
Slow and horrible
Very good
I love this application. As it is very easy to surf and we can surf message and profile simultaneously as well.
Thanks for visiting
Awesome
Hated it
Good
Crashing and messenger? I'll go with the Fast
The lateset update is not good ... because when i open the most recent it open it in a new page ...
Why ? Pls fix this issue. After that will give 5 stars
I really really really really HATE that YOU get to decide what is displayed on my time line. I want to see ALL posts from ALL my friends without having to check most recent. Gotta love Facebook tho!
Cant even open it! Useless!!!!!! Give it 0.
I couldn't update it
After the latest update i haven't been able to open it and when it does open it closes almost immediately.
oooooo
Nice

Facebook
Why is that Facebook messenger can be moved to the sd card but actually Facebook can't? It doesn't make sense.
Still Rubbish! Most of us have to or need to use this app but its functionality, reliability and customer support can only be described as 'Poor'. [It now uses 173MB of memory.] How much more space do you want?
Starting up facebook...just a moment grrrrr
Facebook on device
Your recent updates has a lot of bugs...please fix this...
Only stays open seconds then closes. .fed up reinstalling it
Facebook is so log and crashing and facebook katana is not responding
Never in my life have I had this FB app lock up on me like it has been lately. Came to see the reviews and sure enough I'm not the only one having these issues! How can this get fixed????
I dunno how I feel about the app, it's always freezing up on me and I have to close out and restart. Other than that I enjoy it and appreciate the hard work that went into making it. Thanks Facebook
I don't care if its slow, I can still get on facebook with the app
Great

Even when the app isn't open it still finds a way to lock up my phone to the point where I have to force a restart of my device. Basic functions such as Notifications don't work.

If I could see most recent posts first on my news feed I would put a couple of more stars, using a browser on SG4 mini is almost as fast as the app to browse Facebook. Get most resent posts first on my news feed and I'll edit this rating and post.
Ever since the update it crashes my browser any time I try to open a link.

When you implement dark theme mode you will get 5 stars.
My Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 with Android 4.4.2 constantly crashes using this app, extremely frustrating!  My S5 never crashes while using Facebook

Hi ...friends.....
Why does Facebook need access to my;  camera/ microphone. Phone, call history, browsing data, photos and all of the million other things just to have the app downloaded. It's ridiculous and a violation of privacy
It keep force closing, and its so not fair. Ughh
Niccccvvceeeeeeeeeeeeee
Whenevr i open the app.. it closes automatically...  dumbass update... :@ i wanna give 0 star.. Not evn one for dis stupid update.

Ever since I've changed my number on this app, I've been locked out of my account 3-4 times in 2 months! It says something about proving my identity because of being hacked. Please tell me how to fix this issue so I'm not locked out again.

Not good.

Last system update for my galaxy s3 broke it im assuming,  used to work fine till then, now it shuts off/closes on its own whenever i touch a link or comment or just about anything very frustrating to use closing at random times, needs a fix asap.
Awesome ..
Loved it
It really good for people to talk to friends  and family
Since last update keeps crashing
nice App
I luv dis app.but I have problem in downloading dis app.
Can't use FB app to long into my FB I have to clear data each time I log out before I can load FB. Keeps saying can't load my news feed. And goes bk to my home screen.
Lamest app ever. Useless app comes in no work at all
It is bad application
Its not opening for my phone
alaw
Always Force close to my HTC explorer need help :(
Bad. I have a look at the moment and will have the right thing to do it for a while
Great
Something is wrong since the last update. Keeps forceclosing! Oh my word please please fix the issues with this app!
Perfect for facebooking
It just run very slow
This app is nice.
One of the best app so far
Quality of pictures are horrible!

I have been using this application since many months now on Micromax canvas doodle 2 (A240)(Android version 4.2.1)..sorry to say but i never got a smooth experience....the application crashes if i try to watch videos....photos would not show....it would take forever for the photos to load...tried uninstalling and installing....nothing works....ugghhh...1 star
This app sucks royal *** facebook shut down every time i try to do any thing. Whats the point. And we thought myspace sucked.
After update videos are not playing in full screen.
Reported several times for Micromax turbo A250
Hop this one will work

Yet another premature update. This time the app crashes everytime I hit the search function. I'm also dropping the score because of the ridiculous decision to move messaging to a separate application.
EXCELLENT
Good
i can't install the App.
Working great on HTC DESIRE 816
Please fix it
Since the last update app keeping crashing and closing on its own.
Love
Dont like it
" JUST A MOMENT " woooaaahh , it takes an hour . Ggggrrr SLOW !
great
Since the update every time I open Facebook, it force closes every time!! Please fix and I'll rate 5 stars again!!  >.<
I love Facebook ... but recently the app is constantly crashing :/ Samsung S3
Keeps forcing me to dowload messenger
Kuwais
Since the updated fb has been crashing, showing errors to log in, then to log off I figured going to app settings & deleting cache & data, your app will automatically reset it for successful use but chances are that you're going to be same errors back again if you log out & log back in & same when uninstalled & reinstalled. Sad but true. Life is more than deleting  cache, installing & reinstalling facebook. Very unimpressive!
Very good
Share with frnds
it could not be download properly
For everyone

The best
Its cool but when I try to open the app through the notifications it just goes to a blinking screen
After I installed Facebook its been saying storage space is low
fix this app..
The app closes as soon as it uploads after 2 secs. These updates are really crappy! FIX THE ISSUES NOT MAKE THEM WORSE. Thanks!!
Need some improvement in loading profile speed
nice appp
It's lengthy but worth it. Go to Settings > Apps > Facebook and click on, clear data. Go to Facebook, wait and Login.
Good. But needs to show you which comments are replies to your comments
Nice

Similar to all recent reviews here. Ever since I updated to the latest version, the app runs very slow and moreover it also causes my phone runs very slow as well till I had to restart it twice. Please fix it soon!! Thanks!

Since the new update I can't get on the app at all I only can get on the desktop version. This really sucks and to think that they want to start charging us. I wouldn't even pay a penny for Facebook now because of the problems that's been occurring with the app

The app used to refuse to update, which I am regretting the fix has be added. Since every update, more and more bugs appearing. It's slower, uses more data, notifications don't disappear (that's if I actually get notifications). Just awful app, but no choice, but to use it.
Love the drama...FACEBOOK RULES!!!!!

Cool men I lik it.....;-);-)
Wow
I love this app...
Too sloow
Since system upgrade to KitKat; app continuously closes. Worked perfectly with Jellybean and in my case, I had bought my Galaxy Tab two weeks before the system upgraded...which means I had that whole 2 weeks with an app that worked. Goes to show you that 2 months later,  support team's are working hard to satisfy us, the customers! Facebook worked with Jellybean but not with KitKat; process of elimination could narrow the window of possibilities. What's different between the 2 versions? Maybe they could have used the successful version as a template and apply modifications moderately during their "rigorous" testing period. It's a constant race to produce while the quality lacks more and more! Where is the pride in that!
Bad app
Not bad!....This app must need a messenger....please fixed it.

I just got a new phone so I installed the newest version. It's the only app I've been having an issue with, have to keep restarting my phone so my newsfeed will refresh, otherwise the newest status is 15 hours old. Won't load comments on statuses, moves slow when trying to open a link or video. Going to uninstall and reinstall and see where that gets me...likely nowhere...
Keeps on crashing on my android!
your video player is sucks
BAKARy
U always update this app. This update is too large so i decided to uninstall this why? not u add option to move it in SD Card plz reply must
Unable to open any link from fb. It says something going wrong.
Although the app itself is large an taking up a lot of space. It performes well on every LG phone that I have had. I wish you could Log into more than one account at a time.
Its so annoying! I sometimes click my notifications but ot goes to search or maybe on my chat! Also the loading is super slow!
It sucks
Boy
Mas broo

I refuse to download messenger
nice
Data hungry,  will not maintain chronological news feed, restart and force close issues.  This app is a requirement for people using Android and as such should be prioritised for special attention.  Genuinely feels half assed and clunky,  very amateur. Many issues to resolve,  perhaps going back to the drawing board and starting again from scratch would be the best idea. Do not overcomplicate, SIMPLIFY!
Sloooooooooooooow
Kamta ji
Love it so much:-) !!!!!!!!!!!!!
This app. Always freeze' s on me deleted and down loaded a few times still doesn't work right fix it already
Doesn't have accreditation(meaning untrusted) from some web browsers?? O.o Really, Facebook??

Becomes worse after updates
Since d last update my Facebook keep on disappearing without closing it myself, bcos of dat I can no longer make use of it. Pls fix.
No messages just no
Ever since the last update it doesn't let me sign in, I have to try multiple times then it will let me in. Then when I'm finally in, everything is super slow! Sometimes it doesn't let me like things... Very disappointed
Liked it
I love it

why does emoji cannot view? fix it pls!
The last time I updated this app, it took like forever to open it.. Uninstalled it then installed it back to see if the same problem won't occur again.. Unfortunately, it still did.. Crap!
Good!!! ;)
It is eating up my data usage that i share with 3 other ppl.  In just 7 days i've used up 415 mb!!!! In that time my data usage has tripled. Not to mention it freezes all the time now! Fix it!
Stop logging in let me log in
Superb
This app consumes more space in the internal memory.
LOVE IT
Turn off background data use, speed up down loading. Fix updates on timeline I don't need to see 3 days ago post again.
Keeps crashing
A week now and it's still utterly useless. Crashes before anything can be done, a shocking app full of issues, this last update being the worst of the lot. How such a successful company can't get even moderately able developers to design something that isn't permanently broken is beyond me. It's free, so perhaps my anger is ill-advised, but this isn't good enough.
Fantastic worldly accepted medium
Still working on it
Force closer all over
I hate this app!! ../..
Loving it
Okey
TOO SLOW. HATE TO WAIT IT. PLS FIX IT THX!

Social websites are killing our personal life
I have to delet the app and download every time i want to check my fb..
It's automatically going out of the app... Hell...
Mandatory installation of another app for complete functionality is unacceptable.
This facebook apps it's so good for me and i like this apps so much
Nice
The app is so big... doesnt open easily.... takes 30 secs...
I hate that it takes u soo much space. Wants to scroll then won't. Lose connection all the time!
I think it can develop friend ship and share it
I'm using my Galaxy S Duos, it takes up more memory. It make the internal memory full. Please make a move. Many people dislike this. Thanks.
Mindblowing
Since everyone has to download messenger app to message I hate it, I don't even message people I will not install that app its horrible and of course that we have no privacy!
Ever since the update, it's telling me that it can't load my news feed but everything else will load and open so its definitely not my internet connection. Fix this problem because this is ridiculous....an update is supposed to make it run better, not keep it from running at all.
Since long I m trying to update Facebook but it is not getting updated??  What should I do!!!! :-(     :-(      :-(  should I install a new Facebook....
App keeps crashing whenever I touch anything but a notification or a message (that opens messenger), please fix it is very irritating!!
I can't open the facebook app! It force stopping always!
Really wish y'all would being back the recent statuses and top stories filter back... tired of seeing post from days ago other than that good app
At hap pan
Since i updated it, the app cant stay open!
It's very bad when u admin a groupe or a page .. for example u can't search for members u have to brows the whole list n it's kind of hard when u have a long list , u can't search for one member posts ... that need to be fixed please

Seriously, as years go by, facebook on mobile is getting worse and worse and worse but ofcourse, people have no other choice but to use this because we want to stay connected with our loved ones. And unfortunately, facebook is still one of the most used social media site in the world inspite of its disappointing service so eventually, we really have no choice. :)
Use it easy..
Its nice, I really like it.
Disgusting I can't upload video! !!
Failed app.
Nice working this app with my phone

Why there is no option to download videos... :-\

The more you update the more rubbish it becomes, slow to load and way too many ways to create fake accounts etc, shouldve just left it simple like how we wanted it but no you want fb to keep tabs on everybody... What are they doing, who they talking to.. Your app is a joke
I cant see videos in this app
Same comment as so many others. Is anyone listening?
Newsfeed is the best

Its good apps
Since I updated the app everything went wrong. It's constantly crashing not to mention that it toooooooooo slow.
All these new updates is poor. It just makes everything slower. Takes about 3-5 minutes just to open up the app to see your timeline. Pictures take forever to load, comments takes forever to load, it just slower.
Wow fantastic app
Good
Facebook   is   cool
So slow
How to open my facebook
I used to have no problem with this app. But since it required me to update it's very frustrating how often it completely closes itself. I'm tempted to delete this app because of it . Please fix this!!!!
Good
Very nice i love it
This app keep shutting down, cant go on fb for more then 2 seconds!! What's the point in update if you can't use it after you do!!!

Please fix, don't forget that not all phones are iphone s5's/6 nor galaxy. My samsung pocket cant load it. Phone reboot doesnt help.
This update keeps crashing
Does not open
Since last update android app is consistently crashing, even more annoying when your in the middle of something the app crashes, asks you to fill in an error report and then nothing gets done, not even a reply. Get this sorted because its not just me complaining, but I don't think these comments and feedback even get read, otherwise this and other apps like facebook messenger wouldn't keep crashing all the time
Excellent
This app sucks! It crashes all the time!
Ever since the last update it's so choppy and slow that I can't even use the app. Needs to be fixed ASAP.
Awesome apps
Asp karim
It always crash on my phone! Makes slow loading the picture and videos. Please make it improve.

It's ok ..... its love filmnya d.o
A fantastic application
That's what I'm talking about,this app is the same as the rest of them and worse it is the most popular social networking sites on the internet.I'm just saying that it needs to get faster with the download.

Some bugs causing problems in tagging ?
Alwyz takes longer time to open and crashes often. Pls fix asap.
Good
My Galaxy Nexus ran very smoothly before installing this app. Now every app runs slowly as it competes with Facebook for processing power. Uninstalling and switching to the mobile website, so I can choose when Facebook uses my processing power. Battery also decreased. Using an extended battery, I used to be able to use my phone the whole day. With the Facebook app, it dies in the middle of the day
Up lode to slow
But this very slow
Nice App ;-)
Super
Wonderful use
I shouldnt have too wait 18 mins for it too start loading
book a day together.
Stop crashing
Facebook
Can't load d application ever since i downloaded it
So many issues with this app now! Sometimes it won't even log me in....if it does i can't spend more than a few minutes on it without it freezing....going to a black screen....So slow most of the time..it takes forever to open a picture and I've given up on even trying to watch a video!!! After reading the other comments i see I'm not the only one having these issues! Please address these issues and get it fixed!!!
Yo yo
Since 2 update this app dont work !!  Loading....  And... .... ....  White screen...... ....  Force close...

Hi..
I downloaded the messenger app  but then couldn't see facebook. Uninstalled it but now cannot see any messages that were sent through messenger. This seems to be a rather pointless application.Update: I have to force stop facebook just to log out. This is just AWFUL!
Great,..........
I love it
A placa where u keed in touch
Since last update facebook keeps dropping out, please fix it asap.
Won't load anything. Checked my Internet speed and I'm at about 23Mbps so it's def the app
Good
When using inbox messages. The application forces us to download facebook messanger. Secondly it takes alot of space on my phone eats up the hard drive and the ram. I recommend using the browser version.
Good
It was. Best

Nice very much I
Sucks
Terrible
Sathyam!!!!!!!
So nice app
Where is search from the activity log??i cant find my searches anymore on my phone but from desktop only!!please fix.
The application keeps opening up on its own. I have to force the application to close through my task manager, rather than just backing out of it like before. Only then it's open again minutes later. Battery suck galore. Going to have to remove if this is the case. Which will mean no more FB for me.
Hai... my facebook app is not showing me newsfeed perfectly..fr hours its showing me the same thing when i use in 3g or wifi and my sim is 4g enabled...i really hate it nw...please do try to fix it soon..that will be really helpful. Thanks
I like it very much
good
Ever since the last update, this app keeps restarting and doesn't provide notifications. It has never been able to transfer to the memory card despite its huge size. I uninstalled facebook messenger and will not hesitate to do the same to this if it continues being a nuisance
so slow specially with that messenger -____-
Froze too much.
Facebook
Good
I love it.

Each new improvement seems to be going in the wrong direction!
The app data increases furiously and is not moveable to sd card

I don't want fancy icons, all I want to do is to be able to post, or to go to pages, or to read others comments, and this app stops almost every time I want to do it... Also, sometimes it says that the app is not responding, even if I am not logged in or online at all. And it doesn't matter if I use it in my Samsung Tablet or my Xperia Phone, is the same.
I love facebook
Facebook is getting bored, too slow even to open some pictures
I dropped it from four stars to three. Every time I get on the site it only let's me on for like 30 seconds at a time. I am thinking about deleting the app out of my phone
need to be able to change the stories I see because i see stories from the beginning of the week. change it back to what it was please
I love u neha
I like facebook

Holy crap. This app keeps freezing and shutting down! What is going on. At first I thought it was my phone, but after reading the reviews....I think it is facebook.
Asalamu alaikum
Hmmm
Better than the internet
App sucks original app was better
I hate this, i should take a long time for open some picts, pages or anything.. but i need it-_-
Just continues to crash as soon as i try to post or scroll. Fast becoming a waste of space.

Cant log on and its really slow!!!!!
It almost never recognises my connection to the internet.  No other apps are having problems Facebook, why are you having such a hard time connecting?  Worthless app for an increasingly irrelevant social media platform.    Going back to just accessing Facebook from the browser on my phone because that is infinitely more convenient.
It doesnt allow to like the pages,and send friend request.. dont update !! Fix this problem immideately
no pos wao
Had to get rid of it as update early October has made my Nexus slow to a crawl. Please Fix!
Very slow
SO FREAKING SLOW
Very fast and nice
Ever since the new update, app won't stay open for very long. God forbid I wasn't to look at someone else's page, it closes instantly.... c'mon Facebook makes, fix it!
What is going on with FB since the recent update?  I can't get past 2 minutes without it shutting down over and over again! I see many people are having the same issue. Please fix it!! Your update has BUGS!!! FIX THE UPDATE FB!!!!!!
Since I got this new phone the app doesn't work!
Nice app.
2
Hate it
Won't even let me open the app. Keeps saying that it's not responding and is forced close
So good to me
How about when I've been looking at Facebook for 30 minutes, you don't make me start over at the first of the newsfeed just because I decided to look at a  video someone posted.
Ffft hudd
Good..

But it is built-in in Xperia c which eats up internal memory...after the update is start up is damm slow....

Ok lang
It's low to move. Please update it!
Showing incompatible update 
Since last either android update or facebook update, keeps crashing.  Can't search for anyone without crashing, crashes often just looking at posts.  Miserable to use as is.

Trouble downloading @$#!
I cant even open the app. It brings me to the play store!
Can't able to download it. -_-
Update didnt fix a thing. Still crashes frequently on samsung tab 3. Then again, when you have a billion followers, who cares about a few? Cant wait for the next best generation. There are no loyalties and youre not forever.
Wished they would put the new post first instead of halfway down the page amd old post before the new and also it loads soooo slow!! That's aggravating...
I use it and find it very useful
Since it updated it won't load at all
its more fun in facebook, its so nice to comunicate with freinds and to other people
Keeps closing app
To many updates!! Now it crashes constantly, I'm thinking of deleting it, it's not worth the time wasted...
Fast service 2 connect with friends and family round the globe
very slow nd been crashed i cd not log out easily

This app freezes literally every time I go on it. I noticed it started happening a lot more often after I downloaded the messenger app. It shouldn't be a 'one or the other' type of ordeal!
Abdullah auneri

I forgot my old account info so I made a new account and then it closed me out of the app when I was re-friending people. I then tried to log back in with the new account info but it said that there was no account under the email that I had just used....
I like facebook
This app is cool but it's not better than Instagram

Takes up alot of space.
App so slow to load and show pic and video and app so big....
Shrawankumar Nepali
I have to UN install then 're install to even OPEN the app!! VERY ANNOYING!!!! FIX PLEASE
Funny but interesting...lol  Wasting time!
Gosh dang this app keeps getting worse. Now it freezes and crashes. Plus, I want to view my news feed by most recent without having to pick that option EVERY time I open the app, not by what you decide. Isn't that the point of a "timeline", to be in chronological order?
It was working fine a few days ago. Recently the app has been crashing or refuses to load, forcing me to stop it in multitasking.
Samphors
Hate this app..take up to much space....
You dont like potatoes (-.-)
Wtf!!??
Good.
Farco
I would give your app four stars if you could get extra bugs out of the app and news feed
18.94 mb hell no its more than 18.94 mb

Unable to keep open for more then a few moments before it crashes.

Recent, yes is 8 hrs ago, but MOST RECENT ?!?
Good,...
Nice app ahhhhh
I'm getting really sick of not being able to use the app for more than a few minutes at a time without "Facebook unexpectedly stopped" or "Facebook is not responding".... fix this crap or I'm uninstalling. I'm so disappointed with what this app has become.

I HATE that the update installed! I cant even use it! It freezes then crashes shortly after...
After the latest update, the app has become sluggish and does take too much time to start and many a times does not even start...

Hi there is anything
Taking too much time when starts....pls don't update
Its a nice app..
Awesome
1) When I go and like post on facebook, i exit out, then go back and it updates, but I have to go like the same things all over again! 2) Forcing me to download messenger, when it way too invasive with the privacy.
Boston
News feed won't even load. Pictures won't load either.   Do Something To Fix It!!
For the last few updates there has been a problem with the notifications tab: it wont show me my new notifications, but goes to an old notification that I checked days ago.  This is an ongoing issue.  Otherwise, the app is fine.
Love
After the latest updates its taking too much time for loading.
Good
Good but the size is too big for those of us who don't have enough internal storage
Very bad response from my mobile phone number for your browser such as well

I would give it higher but since the last update it keeps crashing. Fix it asap and will give you better ratings
My favorite thing about this app is that the pictures actually load *sarcasm*
I love this application :)
Why i cannot make a call., whats wrong.,
Driving me crazy. When looking at news feed I'll scroll down, when i see something i want to share I'll share it and continue from where i was. Wait! It started me over! EVERY TIME i want to share something. Scroll down, share, scroll back to where i was, share, scroll back to where i was again (sometimes taking a min or two) share. What the hell is wrong with this app? I hardly spend any time on FB anymore because of this. Out in the country so signal is not good. Please fix your app's memory problem!
Last update sucks can't even use app
the great, fantastic appsss
Omg what a great and smart app to meet up with friends thank u
No matter if all my notifications are turned on, phone has has a factory reset and have the latest update,I am not getting notifications on my phone from this app. Nothing wrong with Optus, nothing wrong with Samsung they have both said it is the app.

I hate that I HAVE to have messenger to get my messages. I do not want it. Also soooo slow!!!
If I would have known it logs out incorrectly. . Then I have to clear the cache and form data to enable me to even get to the log in screen. TERRIBLE UPDATE!
Lg tablet 7.0
Chea!!
i sOo Love this app:) thanks
Can't see videos no longer
I don't got to download messenger yet cause I got the galaxy note 3
Just alot if space too, heard it was bad
So slow and would be better if i could put it on my sd card
Not that good
The update put my FB slow, and freeze screen when i open it.
Apps should not have a mind of their own. Accessing via isp instead of app may work better.  Worth a try.
Its Facebook
muito pesado, para conseguir usar no meu cel, tenho q apagar tudo, menos o whatsapp.
Nice
For years
App loads text but not images. Have uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail! Better chance going through the Internet to sign on FB!!!
Its hang but interesting
Very nice
Good i love it
Very slow to log in hayyy!
faster
Good
After the latest update this app drains my battery super fast. It's the top app for useage on my phone even when I've been at work all day. Seriously?  Id rather just not have it than have a phone that is nearly dead after having not been touched for 8 hours because of an app.
All my LG optimus L70 updates and all attempts to install ANY APP has completely STOPPED working!? I see many people who have the same thing with their phones and tablets. Is this. Google Play Store causing it?Someone. Please. Help us!?
please fix this problem!!!
Fine
Five
App freezes all the time as well as opens links i dont want
Hiii
How is possible nobody does nothing, with the hackers !!!!  Facebook you have to do something
ever since the update the app closes by itself
I can't read messages.  I refuse to install messenger app again. I hate that I get pop ups that get in my way of what I'm doing.
Bro
With y'all wouldn't make us have to download the messenger app
Why I can't read message.
Mobile version is very friendly -  I hardly use the laptop to use Facebook
Horrible! App keeps kicking me off and making me change my name, send them a picture of my ID! So much for keeping in touch with distant friends and family, I can't even get into my account or get any help! Trash
I agree with everyone who rated this app with only 1 star.
U
So I use Facebook a lot and I'm really mad because they decided you have to get the messenger app to message people to me this is stupid. I don't have enough storage to have both apps so now what am I supposed to do?
Loading of pages and pictures are too slow
Fhx
Addictive
It's ok but not ok for my i phone 6
I can't pull up my notifications it pulls up an old post please help
The new update is really sucks plss fix it...If I go to chat it always force closing plss fix it ASAP
D
Makes life more easier
After last update can't get info half the time!! Super slow if it works.
Fi
No bore
brilliant
It suks. Cant delete other people post on my wall....cant see at least three four mont behind what's on my wall....
Wow
What this, you want virus to us.. Do want cheat the people who do make you profits...
I've had this app on several devices over many years. My most recent update has broken all useability on my galaxy tab 3. Consider that facebook survives by viewership it might be a good idea to make sure people can actually get onto the app

No comment

It sucks,itz slow nd messing with my phone i've had to uninstall it twice
Very good app
Love it
Since the update it says tablet has crashed
Iam waiting how many minutes to install for anothing.is not installing i hated many time i make it.
Not Working On My Samsung Galaxy Young
Rubbish aap...
After updating, fb app takes a while to load/start then crashes. Will look for an older version and use that instead.
Its awsome everybody try it but has become so slow
Awesome!!!
Nice
After the last update, the app keeps crashing !!!

This app is not very useful. There is no way to automatically sort the news feed chronologically, and there is no way to see or respond to messages. These are the two things I use the most, and no, I won't have my privacy invaded by downloading Messenger. The mobile website might not be pretty, but it's way more functional.
Could you be more annoying Facebook?
This is the worst app i have ever download
every time i try to sign up it goes to kik
News feed is not loaded very bad properly.
Takes ages to Load and keeps freezing man
Please fix....news feed slow and old news....no pics...slow.... Slow.....and Slower... Ugh
Top superb
Ever since the last update it keeps crashing all the time.
It keeps crashing on me, i get to a post and it fs up. Getting pist off now
Go back a few updates. Let us message people through this app. Not everyone has a phone where you can download the messenger as well. Also this app is to large for my phone can't even open it.
Emmanuel!!!
good
Deleted the app off my phone because it wouldn't stay open. Still have it on my tablet but the app shuts down every time I try to do anything and if im just looking at the post's I have about a minute before it crashes. Maybe it's the universe letting me know Facebook is a massive waste of time.
need to get back to candy crush 156
Good fun to joy
;)
Great app and way to show what you are doing and where you are at! Great technical support! They stay on top of things and are always finding ways to make Facebook better!
Since new update news feed is terrible slow no pictures showing scrambled everything took it off my phone till its fixed
Feel like delete this fucking facebook,billshit update.
Change the settings for most recent
love it
I have a samsung tablet and a windows phone, in both apps I cant get any new information
Every time I'm browsing in my news feed I open some apps and then it close by itself please fix this
Won't download and even deleted all of my frikken pictures and all of my apps.
I cant log with this app . logging time is going to out
Sive
App does not refresh in a timely manner....keep seeing the same stuff on timeline.
every time I try to use it . .mu phone freezes up an I have to take out my battery. it really sucks badly
I hate it
Facebook
Notifications always lag about 20 minutes
So slow
I love it
Awsome
I have to uninstall and reinstall almost every time I used.
Better
Its cool
Want to see most recent....  But you hide inside... Worst me again
Good
Love it
I can't change the sort by to newest.  This is the most frustrating thing about fb mobile app.
Can't even EDIT posts anymore?  WTF!!!  The latest update is HORRID.  And why keep forcing us to update to your increasingly worse versions, by making the old versions stop working correctly ?  You Suck!
something worng
So slow
App keeps crashing
Sucks as others have complained shocked tha it has not been fixed they must not care
When I connect to my home network it's coming slow. I don't know why
Not connecting fb to candy crush on android phone. All the other fb games connect but not my favorite game !!! Witch is candy crush saga.
Cool
So slow evry time i open it...haiszszt.....?
Its buggy glitchy and laggy. Its to big of a download and doesnt even load most of the settings for your account. You cant even watch a video without it crashing. Please fix the size of this app and the app breaking lags glitches and crashes.
Nice aap
Loved it
HORRIBLE UPDATE!!!! my app won't even stay open it keeps closing I have to go on the web browser to look at my Facebook if I could rate no stars I would! Fix this ASAP
Very good
It's awesome I guess
I am VERY disappointed about Facebook on the Samsung tablet,  its basically unusable.   It constantly kicks you out.  PLEASE fix if!
This app has been downloading for hours! I'm done.
It's fine app my airtel give 3G network and its speed is unbelievable.
This app never gets old for me..just wish I could filter some of the stuff in my news feed but all and all I love it
Keeps crashing if I do more than scroll down my news feed.  Even that has limited time before it crashes anyway.
I cant even log in.
Its terrible since the new update...fix it please!!!
Since update,  apps crash when invoked from Facebook. Samsung S3 mini.
Make it faster
nice
You people might not like it but I loved it ,if you would upgrade it .
Good
When you show that a friend of mine commented on a public post from a page, but there are 17,000 comments, it would be nice to be able to click on the "so and so comment on this post" part and see what my friend said without wading through 200 comments...
Hahahhahaha
Not enough satisfaction
Yadav
Why the hell did I just get FORCED to change my name? It's been the same for 2+ years. I don't want to use my birth name for my own personal reasons and its ridiculous that i was just made to change it for no reason, and now I apparently can't change it back for 60 days? This is ignorant.
Since the most recent update on my samsung tablet I can't click on links or comments without getting booted off.  Irritating!! :(
I shouldn't have to download the messaging app when it used to be a solid feature of this app. Thinking about ditching Facebook. Maybe I'll go back to MySpace.
such when this app push to donload app mesengger
It was so slow it wouldn' t open.
To be totally honest, I really do not get on social media nearly as much as I probably should. With that said, I have had no trouble at all with this app. It opens easily, seems very responsive, and it works fairly well from the navigation side of the app in regard to a small business Social App. It is a pretty large app, but has not caused trouble with my memory space, at least none that I have seen. It does help a great deal for the business by not always having to be on the computer.       Keda Dyes Inc
If FB app is open any other app I try to open crashes. What did you do?!
Won't load and says all friends where on 1 min ago
i cant even open it for more than a minute .. its still crashing and having a not responding set up .. pls fix this..
.....
Good

Ever since I updated my Samsung tablet, it never stays open. Every time I try and open something it always closes. It sucks!!!  They need to fix it!!!!
After updated i can't open  fak
I am sick and tired of not getting my news feed the way "I" want it.  I don't care what you consider Top Stories.  I don't want them.  I want "MY" feed, "MY" way.  Before something better comes along.  Re:  some of us are just waiting on our ello invites.
the only way forward ...
Now the app crashes every 10 seconds
Have to delete and reinstall app almost daily just to be able to open it. My phone sucks, yes, but it worked fine before
Ok
GREAT !
It won't load my notifications.
Love Iraq
I have the same problem since I updated
God
Works great
Friendly goodheart. Kind trusted care concern respondable.  Loving.cutewise.
will not Load at all! so slow
The keeps crashing and it tooks forever to load.
All you have to do facebook is read comments from your users. 5 star comments are left by third world slowskies that cannnot spell. One star star comments left by legitimate users with honest complaints.... slow. .... forcing me to download messenger. ..... Just gonna stick to logging in via Web browser. Takes up too much space and Facebook is really not as important as people allow it to be. Uninstall :)
Facebook app keeps on crashing unlike before I updated it. I even tried reinstalling it but to no avail.
In short words ( Last update bad )
I love it havent had Any problems
Good
Its good
Like it
Slower and slower...Why don't someone listen to what the people are saying that use the app on an everyday basis?????
The best ever
Raju
Nice
It just amazing
Always prompts me "you have X notifications and Y messages" but when I click in the page is not available.
B'cozz it is connecting the people......
This app is SO SLOW!!!  HATE IT!!  I swear if it's not one thing it's another. GET IT TOGETHER FACEBOOK! start listening to your users! I have full 4G bars and still it goes slow. Only works somewhat properly when I'm on Wi-Fi which is only when I'm home. Ugh!
Updated - app on steroids!
like this should add more stars.
I cannot reply to a comment, pls give a option to reply comment, this option is available in desktop but not in mobile facebook pls fix this in next update
Cool
Cant even log in please fix it its the only way I ke er p in touch with my momma
Won't stay on. keeps crashing. Loads screen then shuts off. I must have sent you 200+ reports
Liked it but it got messed up on me no idea what happened would like to try it again if it will work good now when I try to down load it my android phone says I have insuficiant space and will not allow me to download it back on my phone.
Its very fast and good
Goood
On my tablet I couldn't load up any apps because Facebook stopped working, so I uninstalled thinking it was just a bug and when I tried to install it again, it said the package file was invalid. Please fix this problem.
I cant even get the app to load. What good is it. Would give 0 stars. Dont waste your time on this.
Why is it so f****n hard to get back on with this fone. No problems with my galaxy note but with this g5s no way. Been trying for 3 months maybe on this time. NOT IMPRESSED.
Works great
It crashes way too often on my Tab 3
If so many faster I was rates 10star. some slow work. please grow up.
Not only does it take up half the space on your phone, it is also very slow!!! Uninstalled.
It helps me keep in touch with " family , friends , and more
Love it <3
Update broken, grey screen then crash message since most recent update
This program is the best I love it
I had to uninstall
Fuckn bullshit
Brilliant
Who ever made this a genius! LOL
Facebook is the one of the good neighbours which is getting nearby the world of Family on finger tips.
Good man
Cool
Awsome
I can't doenload any other thing when facebook is installed. Can't you just make it moveable to the external storage? or make it smaller?
Can u add the "costum privacy" to the options to choose people or groups that we dont want to involve in posts? U only have an option to "show to group" not to "hide from group".
Updated now can't download Facebook says incompatible upgrade
Really Facebook? Every time I click on a link and then go back you bring me to the top of the list and I lose my place in the feed. And what's with this top stories bull? Haven't enough people complained about this yet? I don't want posts from days ago showing in my feed.
This facebook uses a lot of space in my phon's memory. I'll give it a five if it can be moved to SD and reduce size
awesome
Why this app use so much memory?
System hog. Updates do not help
This app is legit
Facebook im very proud of you.
Very nice apps
Requires too many permissions.  Adds lock screen messages, bubbles over other apps... hate how invasive it is and how features take over my phone.
Worst app ever in my life
Very good  I'm happy
Its awesome
Good
sometimes it be moving slow and it dosent show emojies in the statuses i make
It better be faster than the last update, i can't even see videos....
App has been crashing for weeks.   Installed cleared cache and even reset tablet.   Sent numerous complaints.   No response
It keeps me away from fb better than anything else.
Every since the last update, I can't even stay on the app for 30 second with it closing out. Un installed more than once didn't help
Priceless
Does not update when you swipe for new posts
Keeps crashing all the time. Driving me mad. Sort it out facebook
It works.
Great to keep up with friends and new news.

I love it
Simple way to reach public
Lovit
This application is very slow. Suck it !
Samsung 4
Why Facebook me not upload video and voices massage
That's it! sooooo loading when it comes to log in! :-\
Uninstalled and reinstalled.  Still crashes on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Horrible reliability. I would prefer the bugs get fixed before being forced into your proprietary browser.
I can communicate with all my friends on the run
Kool.
Universal communication network for those thag volumteer their time to use this technology.
Idk if it works or not because i tryed on google but it went slow and it was tiney
As soon as I hit the facebook icon on my phone it acts like it's going tobipen & then it automatically closes out & then it keeps giving me an error of authentication access.  Please fix ASAP
Always force close
good
Issue on my Samsung tab 3 after last update, worked fine before. Now I get booted off Facebook when I try to click on my page or friends page. This has been going on for about two months. Is this ever going to be corrected?
Facebook was doing an automatic update and then I realized it was still going days later! Stopped it and my fb was acting up! Deleted it and tried to reinstall and its taking forever! I give up!
Very nice
Messenger is evil.
Nice
was working fine until update now I cant log in.
To slow, and plays videos by its self
The app is too big and is requiring us to download a bigger fb messenger app. Too slow to load for movies and too slow when uploading pics, sometimes it does not upload. I had to reboot my smartphone and clear its cache and cookies. It does not let me log out. Something is wrong with the app.
Y is this crap so d*** slow?!?!?!
really good and fast
How can i reply comments in posts?
Pls new update
Data consumption is very high from my point of view
App
I see i am not the only one. Every time i try to switch feeds or share or anything or do anthing for that matter the app shuts down.
I have tried and tried to create my face book log in and there is nothing but PROBLEMS!!! WHY
Sooooo bad
I cannot see my friend posting even we r friend n following.suck...
Ok
I have the galaxy s4 ever since I updated the app last week, Facebook keeps crashing whenever I open it.  It never did this before. This is a terrible update . Please fix it .
Takes up so much space in your phone
Wort wort worst
No
Because my samsung galaxy tablet keeps shutting down when I try to navigate. Uninstall and install again still doesn't work. I see several others are experiencing the same problem with the samsung galaxy tablet.
...now it keeps crashing.
I updated the app n up to now I can't get into it forever giving trouble
Ever since the last update the app keeps crashing on my galaxy tab 3. Can't keep it open for more than a few seconds and if I try to click on anything inmy newsfeed it closes instantly. Crap.. absolutely unusable and useless
it goes so slow please fix it then maybe i give u guys a better rate
This last update sucks donkey balls. It keeps crashing. Won't let me open links. Plus, it's gotten so slow that I just want to quit using Facebook altogether.
Can't keep app on for a long time
Every time I click on an article or video someone in my newsfeed shared or liked the app goes all the way to the beginning of my newsfeed  when I am done reading and click the back arrow. This is very frustrating!
It's very big size that'swhy my Mobile very slow and hang then I like it
Good
People complaining that 22mb app is too big for their phone need to buy a new phone. What are they using, a phone from 2007?
XD
Hate this app now.  Besides them wanting me to download another app for the stupid messages,  its slow.  Uninstalling
Cant even open it cmon guys!!!
I can't download thhis app due to an error
What a piece of crap!
Waw
Love
"IT CONSTANTLY CRASHES/FORCE CLOSES!!" After havin this app for over a year, all of the updates you had in that time, NOT 1 fixed the problems with the crashin/force close, not loadin pages and/or pics, sayin I have no internet when my internet is fine, errors, stickin, freezin, etc, n freezin up my ph, n the so-called customer service doesn't answer you, it's time to fix this mess!! :-( Please!!! Not a happy customer!!!! >:-(  After the latest update...? Now I mostly can not get on!!!! Great job FB... >:-(
Maratha vel
It was total b.s. when you took out the messenger application and put it into its own separate app. If you're taking it out stop letting me receive messages on the facebook app.
Very fast and reliable app!
The Facebook could be faster loading peoples profiles but the design is great.
it's a nice apps !! i can read all the notifications without hassle but sometimes some page isn't working.
Videos play for a couple seconds then the video freezes and the sound keeps playing.
Crashes after a minute
Obnoxious data collection & always running in the background
liked it
I love it
It too big nd slows down my phone a lot. It also force closes to much
HalimaJamal
..so they can press charges on your mobile device & take it into custody.        The law allows "USA vs x" cases in "court".        (where x= your device)                                   It's called "Civil Forfeiture".                        Your device is guilty until proven innocent.
Good
It keeps force closing and not responding.
Slow and just too many problems
Awesome
It's Facebook.
Can't link to comment on post, view photos, play game etc, etc. Won't let me upload pics.horroble, horrible, horrible
Takes up memory and  doesn't truly move to sd card.  Won't open at all.  Please stop adding useless updates and give us an app we can use?
Add a way to read msg of pages
Good
The app is doing better than yesterday, and it hasn't tried to destroy my phone.
I had a mistake updating this App. Instead of having better app, it gone worse. Veeeeerrry slow!
Nice
Since the last update, I can't even keep a page open. What a joke. I have installed and uninstalled 4 times. No luck.
it keeps crashing :( everytime i update my status
Its ok I guess but it takes a lot longer too log on, on a Samsung galaxy ace. Also takes a min to load a photo or a video
The best app
Keep it op
App keeps crashing needs new update to fix it
Great app-but needs remodelling :-) to suit conversations & feeds.
SLOW
Awesom!!!
That my favorite
Juvinalhall intimate(rabbit)
"Can't even open the app"
Hogs memory & cpu. Makes other apps crash like it's rival twitter. Too many permissions for Suckerberg to hack my device with. Uninstalled. Really it's 0/5.
Since last update can't even get app to open...neither use nor ornament! Sort it out please
After the last update, the app is really slow when loading pictures and videos, not even worth using at the moment..
Udayangi
After update the check in status is at other country n places which is not match...!! Is it some thing wrong had a cure for update status...?? N new is not updated...!! Slow...
Takes up too much memory on some bullllshit
Magnificient
Can't add photos to my albums, especially in groups. When I go to submit them, my screen turns grey & I have to restart the app. Happens every time. There also needs to be a search bar in groyps so that we can find our old posts! If you're someone that does swaps it's a huge pain to have to go through the browser, then to the desktop site, then you get to hope that works. A lot of times it doesn't. If the bugs were fixed it'd be a lot better.
Life is a gift of God, so take care of it.
Practical
Weird
Been a Facebook user ever since I can remember and its been cool. Just the little changes bothers me such as the Facebook messenger and it having to be downloaded in order to see our inbox. Its a cool update and all just our privacy is important. Overall cool app, aloha!
Need to let us message without messenger !!!!!
Update ruined facebook for me. I was on the verge of deleting and this pushed me over the edge. Fix your garbage facebook.
Best app
for an older version.
I use it every time it never closes no adds and works fast its supperbbbbb
Super
Todo fantstico cada da Facebook avanza mas....
Love it!
Getting kinda slow. Liked older version ...  Wouldn't care to go for 4 or 5 stars if I get lucky & have a great update ; fingers crossed hopefully !!!
Good
Gets worse with every update!
Like it
Just dont remove messenger...cuz it works better than the fb messenger app..
Sadly since the last update it completely glitches and lags :(    over all its OK ;-)
Ever since updating the app it keeps crashing and freezing.  Size is way to big for lower end smartphones to handle
Am happy
Love it
Tried installing the app again, it still keeps showing a screen saying I'm not logged off when I am, either that or I get a grey screen.  It needs sorting out.  Going back to the old version without the updates.
Faster than the older version
Excellent
Messi
Okay
Some time it wil be open slowly that I .....

Yeah please do make it so you could. Pass it on to an SD card
The update is terrible. I have to use my phones Internet browser to log into facebook because the app keeps saying "Unknown error" or "cannot connect." I'll fix my rating when yall fix your app.
Am enjoying and satisfied about Facebook. ..
I do update butt it have in problum ... not fine ..
Why are you forcing to download that mf messenger app
Cool.
Very slow to download.
Doesn't even let me open the app.
Ever since the app has been updated it has disappeared off my phone and will not install
Awfully slow and crap...such a pain to use..sticking and freezing everywhere
Can't even open the app. It keeps crashing or freezing. Bad.
Can talk to more people than on instances
so slow on start up.
Please optimise the app for tablet, for wide screen
Really need to let people choose thier own color.
All my friends thanks
Cool
"Turn off notifications" is not working AGAIN since last update. Plz fix. TY Galaxy S5
Facebook Should Have a Multiple Choice Option between which If you block Someone And then you decide you want to unblock them whenever you want. And a wide variety of selections based upon what you really want from asking and find exactly what you want

ever since I downloaded it, every time I click on something it closes, its easer just to go on the web because it doesnt close out. Im not happy with it, I wouldnt even give it a one star, but to rate it i guess you have to. This facebook app needs major work before I will rate a 5 star. :(

Won't let me upload a photo, just freezes and doesn't load at all.
Still has to Improve
It's ok...but wont let me change my cover picture... keep sayin "picture not large enough" wth!!
I am lovin it... :)
One, it runs too slow as I updated the app. The startup, the loading of photos and videos, and more. Two, it takes up a lot of memory in my device, even though I move the app to SD Card. It's always on the top list when my storage space is running out. Three, I found out that Facebook runs in background and is the main reason why my device's battery easily drain out. It's also on the top list of Memory Hogging App that causes my device to run slowly. Please fix this, then I'll give you five stars.
Hated the new update. It closes automatically and its very slow. Please fix it as soon as possible.
connectivity problem + pics load slower + apps too slow.
Thank you for resolving my Facebook issues.    ~ Darlene
Too good
Good
Better
It's a very good application
Absolutely snail paced.what has gone wrong?
But I want something
Nice social fuckin media
Four stars because sometimes it does not upload photos and videos even with great network....
They need it to be faster I prefer the internet to sear h and login do not get this app
If you just add a tool to make font bigger I would rather rate 5
"WE WEREN'T ABLE TO POST YOUR UPDATE" I couldn't upload my photos. I've already uninstalled the app and installed it again but still I couldn't upload my posts.
Occupy so much space....make mobile slow.
Good
Ty
Sucks. Keeps force closing. They made the app too big; can't keep stable.
For this application
Too big and too slow to load pic. Pls fix it sync pls
Slow app too much

Great
Won't play any video on app
it absolutely sucks it doesn't log me out all the way and when I try to sign in i have to sign in several times even if I put in the right e-mail and password I would rather use the website the app sucks in my opinion
Hippos and horses
App is very heavy and slow should be changed

Newest updaye sucks. Can no longer remove tags by other ppl and remove photos.
This update is making everything slow
I have a Samsung Galaxy 3 10.1 tablet.   Since the last upgrade,  FB crashes continually.   I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling,  clearing the FB and partition cache,  and as a last resort a factory reset.   Nothing has fixed the issue,  so the problem is with the 4.4.2 upgrade.   Please fix! !
Super
g
This Facebook app good
Facebook is crap when u log out it says open a browser!!FIX that crap
Delayed notification!
I loved very much
very" goOd
Awesome. Games, some great while others not.
(1) I'd like to use the app again for private messages. (2) I cannot choose to post to specific people only, which is an old feature in the iOS version. (3) Facebook clearly sees Android as a second class product. Most of their efforts go to iOS.
Fine
I had downloading this app twice but its still doesn't working properly..I dont know how to give a feedback to the developer but honestly I dislike it since new update done by developer..for developer please fix this error as soon as possible...
Iits very fine
Yes why itis unexpectivebly android stop? Every time I log in
Not working with 3G networking properly its very slowly
Love this
Hangs my phone
i have nothing good to say about it.. takes to much space on phone, too slow..
Slow
Thapa
Awesome appp..... yr..
This app gonna suck its to slow wtf
awesome
Fye
The app will shutdown  so often that I barely use it. Will stick to browser and uninstal it
This app has been working until today. Now I am having an unexpected sign in error.  "An unexpected error has occurred. Please try to sign in again."  When I do this,  it still keeps popping up.
Good
This apps is suck. Super lag
It stinks.   Turns off/on at will
Good

Its so fine application ... I loved it
I love fb i can share what ever i want with my friends and family!?!!!!
Freezing,  won't let me upload any photos.
Super.......
Everytime I search for someone or a friend to write on thier wall the page freezes and then closes the app, have uninstalled and reinstalled to see if this helps but doesn't and only happens on tablet, sort it out and I might change the rating, I know its not just me having this problem!!
It is the worst facebooking experience after updated.....
I like this app
With every update FB mobile don't work. I can't stand this please fix it.
Super slow. -_- please FIX asap.
Keeps closing and freezes up
Super app
Facebook
Best in the world
The built in "browser" for opening links is garbage. Literally EVERY time I follow a link, I have to then select to open it in another browser because it won't display correctly, especially if there is video. There needs to be a setting to choose to not use the built in browser.     Messaging worked fine. Now you have to use a separate bloated app that requires permission for access to too much.
lylin6666
Since the new update i cant log in every time time i open it, the screen goes grey and closes
Should fix this app asap.very upsetting.keeps on telling me "try again",something internal problem occured..dunno what's wrong. my connection is fine.1st time to encounter such problem please fix it..s
My Facebook  don't work ! Error what's wrong ?! Please ! Keep telling me page not found !
It's okay
i already update my facebook apps but always not responding when i open it...fix it and i will give u 5 star
This is the best Facebook app
Bullshit what is this update too hangy
Thanks for that special occasion to be honest I don't know how to get a free Google search engine optimisation services and products with these people are going through a lot of money. This is an excellent job and have you ever thought it might have a great deal with a little while, so that we are able, but also for you, I think
Links to external websites do not work at all now.
loved et
to slow, Hitting up my phone like never before eating battery 50 percent more than before and can't even write a message it's force close i have a worse experience........  fix it
I have an LG lucid for two years now.   This last update...I can't post to facebook. It keeps failing, crashing when I simply try to update. I can't share songs from spotify like I used to.   I use facebook for work.  I am highly disappointed that, paying 100 a month for a smartphone on Verizon and none of you apps work properly!  Ever since I updated facebook a few days ago and page manager....its been nothing but a hassle to put it nicely.  Wise up developers!
App closes as soon as I open it
Must use it
Since the update it won't let me log in and has slowed down
It is good effort but when I start chat with my friends I need to install a sperat facebook messenger?
Facebook suddenly sync all of my facebook friends contact without permission. It eats a lot of memory urrrg
grrrrrr!!!!!!! Wtf is happening here... everytime i open it.. it closes 2... C'mon guys!!!! Fix this problem.....

I'll give this a five when i can totally hide my profile from everyone but my friends. Especially dont like that people can look me up by just typing my name in the search menu.
Terrible. It takes up way too much space on my phone.

Constantly closes unexpectedly, can't search for anything/anyone. Can't update my status... super frustrating. yet, don't have an issue on my small prepaid phone? So irritating, I love my tablet and prefer using that..... Would love the older versions back!
The latest update has made the Internet connection slow. pictures and videos in newsfeed take ages to load.  The notification panel they good but when tap on them , they hardly ever load. Also Facebook Pokes was working fine before the update but now there 9/10 chance it will not load. This app was a lot better before the update.  Please fix these problems to return it to a 4 or 5 star rating.
Cannot even log in since last update, will change rating when fixed!
The app has become very slow at response lately.
Awesome App. It to Fast working To fast uploading imgae video location ETC.
it makes facebook slower.plz fix it.
Since last update my phone freezes up, shuts down, drops calls. Someone in the development dept definitely messed up.
Really good.
Ok

Good for me and all
Fb team must have been putting all of its resource to keep the kitkat users satisfied. While older os, must have to endure the lags and bugs.
Too slooooooooooooooow

Since updates, FB continues to freeze and crash ..Aaaaand the app does now show and or allow access to 'album' Videos?!? ..nor will it show in browzer. 
I hate that I HAVE to have messenger to get my messages. I do not want it.
This app has been force closing, not loading the notifications and having errors.. Now i cant even log in after uninstalling / reinstalling. Please fix!
Very easy to find our old friend's
Takes too much space from my phone memory.

Since I updated yesterday,  I've been unable to post anything to fb. I can read the wall but when I post or try to open an article, it says the post has been deleted or I do not have permission to view. I Uninstalled the app and will try again later to install it again.
Itss sooo slowww yarrr
News feed
I'm able to get on it once every six tries. Haft to force close the other five times, I send reports to see if it can be fixed and get no response back. So I'm uninstalling it and just using a computer for Facebook.
Uses WAY too much space on my android...I will make do without it!
Good
Ever since the last update takes forever to load.  Phone keeps going to sleep 2 or 3 times before it loads.
I can't upload Photos! Every update seems to make this app worse! Please fix it!
Good application
PLEASE BRING BACK THE MESSENGER IN THE FACEBOOK APP AGAIN!
This app need alots of storage. It's really late to working and using.
Pappu Parihar

Pls fix it ! It didnt work in my samsung young !

Way too big
Very nice
I wanna copy posts -_-
Update made everything extremely slow, uploading pics is nearly impossible now. If fixed will change rating.
Why it keeps crashing on me? Everytime i try to go in it takes me out.... what the heck!
Ok
The Facebook has improved greatly since it first came out. It is faster and more stable than ever, unfortunately it is now missing functionality. When you receive a message, you get a notification with the content, yet you cannot view it without a separate app which wants access to everything. It is also yet another running process on my phone. So I personally use the mobile site for messages instead. Please fix the app or allow it to open messages in Chrome.
Cool:(
Amazing
Nice apps
This App So Big & She Need Big Space
I gave one star because picture loads slowly and videos too. You're more like you are going to throw thy phone...
Slow and crashes a lot since last update.
It's good but very big size
The app has become a nuisance since I updated it. Keeps closing every time I try to launch it. Get it together yo.!
Scd
Now with no chat. Can't delete people's comments.
Gooooood
Gotta keep updating every few weeks because it slows down and quite frustrating!
Spybook
Nice I like it.....
Sends out an error preventing me from posting or liking anything ! Pls try to fix this :) (on Nexus 5)
This app sucks. It freezes all the time or just closes out suddenly. Won't load pictures. I'm just going to use the full web site. This is useless since I updated.
Have only been able to open fb once in 3 days. Continually crashing or won't open at all, utter rubbish. Sort this out Facebook!
It takes a large space to store n wrks vry slowly
Awesome
Fully entertainment
Takes too much time to install and it's too slow.
Dellet
Why fix something that isn't broken and make it worse.
I'm just give 3 star because this apps take to much my android memory ...n use cache to much....but another side...I'm like to use this apps...
I can't even log in due to the "Setting Up Facebook" each time I open the app.
Super ....
This app had always worked fine on my Galaxy s3 tab, but suddenly yesterday it has started crashing everytime i click on anything.
This is so so frustrating.
Laggy and so slow to load pictures and videos ..
Its takes long tym to load pics
Lllllllllllllll
Lol,why after update,i can't log in into fb,or take very long time to log in...please fix back laaaa..
New update sucks! Cant upload pictures.
What in the world?? Also can't tag a person that is not a friend in the comment section.. Not a feature that I wanted.. Also, such a battery drainer!
This app used to be really easy to use.  I like the paneled swiping moving between the news feed and profile etc.,  but doing something simple like searching your friends list for a specific person no longer works for whatever reason.
The app is to slow isn't good at all please fix

It move very slow
Nothing
Too large size and slow.
It's free
It is too nice app
Love
After I updated this app it started to run slowly.. Even loading would take a lot of time...
NOW MY NEWS FEED OR PAGES WON'T LOAD! Can't do anything but look at notifications.   
Considering you have the best software engineers working for you, and you're going to pay $19b for whatsapp, you obviously have the money. How come you make such an incredibly slow and clunky buggy app? The only logical conclusion is that it is deliberate and intentional. Why is beyond me, but considering I'm just a pleb nobody with no knowledge of the variables, it's understandable.
Its really great!!
Plz fix it
Before the new update app was working fine. Now shuts down without warning & loads slowly! Fix this immediately please!!!
Because it slow
keeps relaoding when scrolling down and the app closes by its self. fix this plz
I can upload nothing even with my full strength Internet connection.
It won't let me log in
It keeps on saying #2 temporarily unavailable, and I can't like or post a new status update.
Yes
Very slow facebook app...pls fixed it....
Getting  message of "trouble loading newsfeed. Tap to retry".  Then it takes forever to load!  These bugs/problems need to be taken care of ASAP.
Since last week's update, everytime I open it, it says "just a moment" and a moment would last for 10 minutes then finally it would close.
It won't let me post anything right now.. Saying service temporarily down... But I can like things..
For some reason every so often the app just closes on me whether its when I go to add pictures or comment on something it justs shuts down! Very irratating needs to get fixed I've tried everything on my end unistalling and reinstalling rebooting my tablet so I know it's not on my end!
sucks cant believe this is happening my facebook wont install since I reinstall this app cuase It wont open fix please
Can't load anything on it. Please fix!
Facebook closes up while reading posts
I like this social web
Since I've updated it won't let me post anything!!!!
The app closes on me all the time. It won't let me post or like anything. Says something went wrong all the time. It sucks. Two pictures take over an hour to upload. I don't have time to waste on this crap.
P o majar bari  ps silaphatar  dis  dhemaji

Okay WTF!? I'm on my Wi-Fi and it refuses to log me in! Ugh!
Nice for communication
Hate dis up
Good bt batery consuming app. After every 2 hr run for finding socket to charge.
Cool so far
I haven't got any notifications for anything other than messages on the Facebook app oh any of my devices. I've contacted them multiple times and they've never contacted me back.  I decided I don't need notifications so I disabled them.  If it's disabled why does Facebook continue to run in the background?
Slow as a turtle, closes unexpectedly and takes too much space and doesn't let me update. How can it have so many updates and still be this crappy? Please fix this now!
Saying something is wrong
Nisthar.cherukode
Cant tag friends, cant upload pics straight from phone and runs so slow. spend most of my time looking at the loading ring ggggrrrrrr sort it out facebook or i will be getting a divorse

App moves so slow now. I even tried uninstall and download again... No better. It just spins like it's buffering a video. Not a happy user.
Its help to cummuncte
The fb is okay
If you have a samsung tablet, don't waste your time. Has been shutting down for over a month with no fixes from Facebook. Don't waste your time with the app, use a browser or download line to use instead. Apparently FB has no intention of fixing the issue.
Crashes on loading pictures never had this problem before!!sort it Facebook it says will retry but I need them on now! And won't even let me post my comment on a page.. takes the p**s!!

But can't share a photo on the time line from an album of a page if you are in the album view.. share option in the app's menu only takes you to android share menu
Since the new update the app crashes whenever im on my newsfeed and randomly when im doing other things within the app. Its VERY slow now and is no longer smooth and seamless for me. Ill edit once its fixed.
I love fb
Very disappointed!!!  Come on yaar!! This app is taking half of RAM space, after updating I am not getting notifications of my phone's notification bar!!! I would have rated 4 
it is very big in size, stores a lot of data on my device. background processes eat my battery very fast.
I would give 5 stars but it takes long to upload videos pics etc. Now I can't like a persons status. Please fix
Ami
Too slow
Good
If i could i woukd give it 0 stars. On tablet app keeps crashing or completely freezing then turning off. Since last update even worse now. Awful on tablet.
Can't connect to fb...keeps saying 'unexpected error'
Cool
Good
Nice and handy portable you could use anywhere as long as there is a wifi
wth?  two weeks of no pictures and now I can't even log in!  get your act together already! !!!!

Hi
It is the 2nd time I downloaded the app and I am very sorry to say  that user should avoid this app bcoz it makes phone slow and makes it hang. May be suitable for 8 gb int memory & 1 gb Ram.
It's getting slow :(

I don't like that the newsfeed is different from my phone to my computer. I also don't like the fact that I can't share things from my wall into a private message like I could on the desktop.
Poor. Very poor -_- I think it needs improvement. :3

The app works fine...i dont have a bazillion different apps on my phone to slow this one down so it works perfect for me. All these bitchy people should do a hard reset, reinstall the app and i bet $100 it will work fine!!!

Facebook should be an app that communicates and delivers a great social experiance but all it does is deliver problems. Apparently all content once posted belongs to facebook.

This app is carp I mean facebook should concentrate more on performance rather than appearance.Messes up other apps that need facebook support.Slow scrolling,and what the heck why do I need a separate app for chat.Even if u fix it I won't give a rating higher than 3 star.
Messages are separate
Youre recent updates has a lot of bugs...please fix this...
Videos not working some times session get lot out

Dude everytime i checked my girlfriend's timeline she changed profile pic about 4 months and in my chat is her profile pic about 2 years ago fix it please
The past few months the app runs like crap, but reading the other reviews I see that I aint the only one having problems, I find it easier to just use the mobile/desktop version, much less of a headache.

Perfect
Good
What have you done guys. Since latest update the sysyem constantly crashes and llogs me out. Only way around this is by deleting and reinstalling app. Please fix asap 
Since my samsung tab was updated facebook crashes constantly. I can't click on any feeds. I have cleared data, cache, uninstalled and reinstalled but still not working.

When I downloaded the new update, it got rid of Facebook and it won't let me get it back!!!
Amazing
every time i open the app it much more loading "setting up facebook, just a moment", like first login, when i have fast connection. i must open the app to see the notification.
Very unhappy atm. I get into fb for a few minutes then it disapears its slow it seems to freeze when i scroll. Please fix it its driving me nuts!!

This app is no longer convenient to use and I'm disappointed as it seems as though my data consumption has almost tripled. Updates are supposed to make the app better, not worse! Maybe it's just the sg4. Is anyone else experiencing this problem? Perhaps someone can explain to me why this application is sooo hectic on data now? Please fix this and I will change my rating.

Very very excellent
Awesome app
I think you are very....
Thanks to CyanogenMod, I can block the outrageous permissions that the Facebook app wants, making it functional for me without giving up too much control and access to my private stuff to Facebook. Why do you need to read my text messages or look at my calendar?  How about allowing users to opt-in to this stuff instead of forcing it on us?
Constantly crashes, does not open, slow, will not load pictures, have given up
Its really good
It won't log out keeps throwing up an error message, very annoying
OK
Boringgggggggghh!!!!!!!!!!!
Relly
Can't see photos OR view videos AGAIN! Despite whether I'm connected to wifi or 4g. Problem has persisted for the past week! This app is so useless!! When i upload photos through this app the quality gets sliced in half! What's the point of having this app when i can't upload photos without them turning pixalated. I'm done with FB. It's one thing after another!
The news feed has started working inconsistently after recent update.
...
Bloody slow. And doesn't even open properly. Closes as soon as I open the app
All of your thinking about are wrong,so why they are slow its all because of internet
Nice
Wow

This is a not good app for people
Since you add your own picture uploader  it is real PAIN to add NOT RECENT photos. I don't want to spend hours scrolling down to pick up the one I need. Its "good looking" and very, very, X1000 inconvenient feature.
So lovely
Fun
please fixed my status can't change to friend to public if im finish to  posted so what happened can't change Not alowed please fixed
Always Connected with friends
It crashes almost every time and nowadays "an unexpected error" is occuring every time I try to login
Wait for a long time to enter the program.

I can took with my friends and I can took with any one so I like it
after the last update this app does not launch please rectify the problem am uninstalling ...
Sweta
Super app
I
I see the feed filters, I choose "most recent" and all I get is still "most popular". I see too much ads, too much "recommendations". After the last update all my app settings and Messenger settings have reset themselves to default. Loads slowly, sometimes it does not connect despite good Internet connection. Takes too much space. The app sucks a lot. Not hearing the user's opinion sucks even more.
I would "no star" this app. But its the only way to stay in touch with friends. This app. Also spies on your mobile device which is bogus.
Good
Its easly communicate other people
Ok
Why be forced to have messenger when u don't want it at all???
Wow
Good for smart phones
K update pls
Angel
To load picx and videos
The news feed will not load 80% of the time. At first I thought I was having connection problems but Facebook loads in my browser just fine. And, of course, I am extremely disappointed that you have to go to the "More" tab to view "Most Recent." Why I continue to use Facebook is beyond me and that needs to change. This product is ridiculous, as is Facebook itself.
MR COOL
is ok

after update facebook app can't start. total junk
Bad app pic upload problem ..very slow.. Not tag to all frndz Plz fix it...

Big disappointment when Facebook requires to install a separate messenger app. I don't like to install extra apps on my phone, plus hate the feeling being forced. ..either to download the apps or you won't be able to chat with your friends on Facebook. I choose not to chat
I really miss a way to share something by inbox conversation.
Way to many glitches and force closes. This update sucks.
Fb
can you please fix this app       .....im trying to open it after i update it and i cant open it and its too slow ....and if you fixed this app i can give you 5star
App freezes all the time, it's slower takes really long to upload. Constantly get the Facebook is not responding screen. Really close to uninstalling. Please fix it.

Could not play video
I can't send messages!
The Facebook app on iOS is so much faster,  more simple and attractive. Why do we get stuck with a slow ugly complicated version? And for the love of god just get rid of the "top stories" garbage. NOBODY USES IT. IM TIRED OF HAVING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A SEPARATE TAB TO SEE MY ACTUAL NEWS FEED.
Facebook
It barely runs and when it does it takes a hour or more.
Hate that I have to see top stories and not most recent in news feed

Your update has ruined the app!
It's very awesomeness

the app takes a lot of space in my phone plus the messenger app that I have to install just to view my messages,
must download
Woh
Runs slow
I not like. This. App
Worked fine until the last two recent updates. When it opens the app says it has to close. If I manage to keep it open, it takes forever to load. Not just stories but comments as well. Have even used a phone cleaner. Still no joy. Just s crappy update
I like these app. And so simple and very interesting .... Actually is a so faster
Loved it
It won't let log out; and if I want to log out I have to restart my phone

Not good..cause everytime hank when logout

Best app I ve ever seen
It won't let me disable auto update for this app. But it will disable for all other apps but this one. I can use my inbox in the app if I remove updates.  I'm not downloading messenger so get the hell over it.
It not good    as it's looking
I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I can tap this app and it loads fine most of the time..But this is where the problem starts, as soon as i try to "like", "comment", or "share" it kicks me out 95% of the time back to my tabs homescreen..Ever since the most recent update this has happened..all my other apps have no issues like this, does anybody  else who uses a Tab 3 have a problem like this??
Ja sa sham
Its awesome.........
So Facebook kicks you out if you dont have the new messinger update  They really want to see what ur doing and hear what ur doing with out ur knowledge
Not working in my asus zenfone 5 3days gone already
Slow on 2G network
This app literally made my phone reach 138 F cause it was taking up most of the CPU. Looks like I'm about to uninstall this app and just stick to the computer version of Facebook.
Amitdas
Its a good app but for some reason it keeps bringing you to the top of your news feed when you never scrolled up or clicked the news feed button. Please fix this so I can actually read all the posts before the new ones come up.
For an older version
I Love you my dear babe
slowest by far.whenever i try n use it it stops.!
Eh... It's alrightish, needs updating badly,  but everything else is OK
Bullshit.
Elayaraja
You have to keep on waiting for hours before a page opens and it takes alot of space too
OK
This app sucks it keeps kicking you off fb
Loved THis App
Good
I was once again forced to update this app because of the massive amount of changes being made and now my notifications won't work. Why does this app need an update every 7 hours anyway?
Watching Videos it would Log out by itself and alot of updates
Facebook has slowly sucked over the years.  I would think with all the technology y'all could make this app better.  I'm about to delete my account & facebook forever.
Very Slow
Facebook
The app is constantly using my GPS, not worth it in the least. Messages being put in a separate app is also a terrible solution. Maybe fire your army of programmers and hire ten that know what they are doing?
Awesome.  . But still need dome improvement. ....
too much space...
After the newest update it force closes all the time
FB is not faster..it's slower and I don't like it..in update me!  Now!

Great app they change it a lot but it works well thank u!!!!!!
Cant upload photo direct from files..
Halith shah
It is slow
The app is terrible compared to the previous one, you could at least message each other without having to have a seperate application opened up like FB Messenger. FB will realize it when people lose interest, they'll be  the thing of the past, like Myspace
Cant even click on a profile or a pictures or the app will close.. ALL THE TIME
try this app.if great.unique
It force closes constantly, takes forever to load when it does come up. Please fix..
its too much memory used !!! dam!!!!!
The app constantly crashes since the update, please fix
Won't let me upload pics, and is always foreclosing.....
It works 100% its really good I would recommend downloading it
Since the last update the app doesnt work right and is slower than ever! And now you have to download a separate app to message! Please fix this!
Hate how you always have to update and if you don't have a lot of space this can be a huge problem
It has not worked properly since i updated. Please fix it.
OK I'm wondering why does it kick me out of FB every time I'm scrolling down my news feed  I'm on a Galaxy tab 3 it was fine before the last 2months it's been doing this.
Cool
Since last update, app goes into setting up each time I run it.
Need to update this app to run more faster and smoother. Try to lag when scrolling throught timeline.
Very long time pass
Love it
constant freezing and exiting app by its self on a regular basis since updating.
Great
love  it
Awesome
After the last update, I can't open the facebook anymore. Please fix it!!
Mmmmmmm :-P
Wakk
Crashes not just one time every f*cking time...nice update for what? Just to kill our data the fact it's even slower now?!?! Pitiful Web designers/programmers whatever you wanna call yourselves.
facbook
Using facebook android application from a long time. Now it seems a bit boring to us. We wish some customizations like availability of various themes and new font styles and options.
i open the app and its just force close -_-
reang
It's so slow now. Videos seize scrolling. Makes my whole phone glitch and I have an awesome LG. it doesn't even load or read my WiFi half the time . Reinstalling again

Very  useful app
It crashes a lot please fix

Disliking this app already. Need to fix it please.
.cebu city
I thought I was the only one having problems, glad to hear its ur crappy update and not my tablet. Fix this!!
Everyone might wanna check out Myspace when their android mobile app is ready. Or check out Ello when they are finally open for public. In the mean time the alternative is only Google+ which i cant say much any better than this thing. At least google+ mobile app perform a little better. Weibo should have been available in english.

Ricardo Emmerson aka king
Hate it
Facebook _we saluting the biggest socity of univers
Cant acses it
Bring back messenger to the main app.
Keeps me connected
Its so slow and doesn't respond, terrible app!
Keeps closing when used on my Samsung Galexy Tab3... even Samsung's recent update to kitkat failed to fix this.  Todays facebook app update failed to fix this.  I did a factory reset, and let Google update all the apps, then installed Facebook and Facebook message. ... still closes when using Facebook.    fix!
It almost destroyed my phone, because I tried to exit a video that wouldn't load.
This app takes forever to log out now :/
Great
Good work..
i like it
I cant send any audio messages at all like wtf please fix
Good
Jose   PlNeDa

Super
Kewl
Why is it consuming so much RAM? -_-
It keeps closing on me FIX IT!!
Won't let me turn off notifications of posts i've commented on anymore. I'm tired of my phone blowing up.
This is a good app thank you
Wtf
Loved it
get Facebook
Facebook is a great place you can keep up with family and friends
Slow
The latest version of Facebook for Android enable notifications on lock-screen. However, it allows users to change settings what should be showed on lock-screen (Facebook, Messenger or Turn on light). This is inconvenient because anyone can make changes. Please remove the setting buttons on lock-screen notifications, putting it in the setting of Facebook for Android. Thanks.
This slowed it down so much I'm thinking about dropping it from my phone. It's plain not good.
Sucks
Anything possible
I like this apps
That misses his beautiful daughter Aishia Z Waller the most smartest lady i know and i love her the most.
I have problems with watching the videos
Perfect
I cannot install
This is the DUMBEST update! I don't know how you have 4 out of 5. Change it back
Okk
Facebook doesn't need update. It takes up more and more space on my phone so everything runs slower. No more please. And just show the most recent feeds first not top stories. Uninterested
Always it shows error loading news feed
QUEEN DIVA
Takes up to much space
Im just irritated with the fact that we have to have facebook messanger just to see our facebook messages . We shouldn't have to download another app to see our messages from ANOTHER app . Thats dumb ! Taking up our phone space .
This app is slow
It slows eveything down and always me erase videos and pics and apps for notting. Bring a better version
Everytime that I open the app, it takes ten minutes or longer before I'm able to read what's on my page. If you can make it faster, I'll give five stars. Thank you. P. S. I have an android ZTE
I use this on my tablet and it will force close after about 30 seconds of being opened. I have checked the tablet for updates and im up to date and i also have the latest version of FB installed. This is just irritating.
I can't even get the app to load anymore. It only shows old posts on my newsfeed. Awful. Wish I could give it zero stars.
always not responding!!! kindly fix!!!
How the Hell do you change news feed to recent stories not top...????/
App closes everytime i open it. It's so frustrating that i hardly use facebook anymore.
Hell of fun
To many attempts just to login
Please return the previous update. I can not see all the recent photos on facebook pages. I do not like arranging by albums. Please fix!

I like it. It is good social network
it's so big and so slow. . and need to have fb messenger. . i don't want the fb messenger
Since the update my groups no longer open, and I hate how I need two apps to cover what one used to. I have been using my web browser to send messages because I don't have storage space for messenger. So lame!
Cool
Lovedit
Great!!
Takes so long to start up since I updated it every time I open it after its takes like 30 minutes load in it say face book is not responding
I love this thing
It keeps freezing and having problems logging in
Can't turn of the notifications. The option is there but everytime I comment on something,  I don't want my inbox filled with everyone else's comments. FIX THE "TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS" FEATURE!!!
You've taken a good thing and made it worse then ever the format is so bad please return it to its original form
A
Quicker than going online using a computer
Seriously? You really need to improve this one.

My app was working well, since I've changed phones. Now about a week into it, it won't stay open. Every time I open the FB it just shuts down..THUMBS DOWN !
and no matter how many times I clear cached it keeps on getting bigger up to 54mb even if I'm not connected.
Aesome

Since the new update it just opens and closes straight away?????
LOVE IT
Good
Every five minutes it stops responding. Needsvto be fixed.
Love it!
It keeps glitching and freezing. It doesnt let me sign out. Then i have to uninstall then reinstall just to use it only once. Because after i sign in, then it doesnt let me sign out. Then i have to uninstall it just so i can sign out. Fix this facebook. Or ill stay off facebook for good. Then you and the government will have to find another way to spy on me.
Useful update....
Nice
Facebook
Good
Facebook has always been the best
Wow

Latest update for droid is awful.  Constantly has errors and is very slow.  I would suggest not updating until the bugs are worked out.

#awesome
I cant install the app on my Sony Xperia Z1 :(
news feed is slow and post are old not happy with update
Mtaan Mohamed
every time i open the app it much more loading, like first login, when i have fast connection. i must open the app to see the notification.
Of course it's good...it's facebook
Some posts are not appearing on my timeline and the timline of others. Tried going to fb in chrome and I can see those that are not appearing on this app.
I am NEVER downloading Messanger... not happy about recent changes either. Time line shows a fifth of what my friends actually post and what happened to birthday reminders????
Muy bien
Newsfeed
Stops responding had to be restarted and it happens teen times a day Betty annoying crashing as well after watching a video fix it until them I'm uninstalling DVD using browser
It got faster but still tooo slowww!!
TAB 3 10.1. Can't do anything on it ,  it forces itself  to close soon as you click on a picture or goto your own feed
New open link within feature makes youtube hesitate and not play video smoothly.
Every time I try to open the FB app it opens then shuts eight back down!! Terrible!!
nice
I know what this app wants. A new model phone with bigger storage. It's telling us that we need to upgrade our old phones with new ones. I recommend uninstall. Use FB with browser.
Something as simple as scrolling,  try to play video and Fb crashes.  Terrible update and cannot go back.
I am dissapointed when the new update take me an hour to open the facebook for me to sign in. I cant log in because the facebook is always setting up..please fix as soon as possible thanks I will rate it 5 stars if you will not ignore my request. .Thank you a lot
Having to many problems . Crashing, errors, eating up phone space and battery. Uninstalled and reinstalled several times now . Not working. Won't even open.
Issue on my Samsung tab 3 after last update, worked fine before. Now I get booted off Facebook when I try to click on my page or friends page. Please fix
I've facebook

It's the best!!!
Lol
Crazy apps old version much better

My news feed rarely updates itself without me going into my applications and force stopping it, Sometimes it logs me out and won't let me log back in...some serious problems that need fixing.
Eddie

It's a good
It was good but den i slwed down and takes for eva to load up:-(
Too slow
Every time anything happens on facebook it sends a text from several different numbers. I have looked and looked for a solution to this but so far thier is no way to turn it off. I will give this app 5 stars if fixed and i am sure several other ppl would to. PLZ FIX I AM JUST ABOUT READY TO DELETE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!
garbage
Good
Oh I can really get in touch with my ellet friends
Easy way to get in love it
It kicked me out of my face book friends finding section when i was asking my cousins for friend request
Best ever
I can change my profile pic add videos, etc but it will NOT update my news feed.  PLEASE UPDATE IT!!!!!
Great update!
Lagi na lang pag nagbubukas ako ang tagal kong naghihintay,tapos magbukas man ang bagal naman ng facebook

Like it
Good.  Needs to be updated more frequently.
Scarface
No
Hope you fix it what others complaining this app.  Please fix this problems.
I love this app but there is things need to be fix like when i write any comment or post .... etc they till me that it's been written an hour ago. that's it.
Everything else is great but I CANNOT STAND that it requires you to download a messenger app in order to read your messages.....
my facebook won't open
When i browse every time it close with out any thing
Had to uninstall app. Never wanted to load. If they fix it I will give it another try.
Very good
Never loads news feed always a error loading just always a problem.
Was suppose to be faster and more reliable?! Force Closes More Than Before and Now Can't Even Watch Videos... Facebook is starting to SUCK
Until this app starts working correctly then your rate is gonna be a 1 star
Fun
Fair
Very slow to load pics and videos.
If you're a Facebook fan then you have to have this app... it's essential along with Twitter, Instagram, Pin It etc. It is perfect!
I cant log in!!!
Cannot log in or out. Have to reinstall everytime I want go on facebook. Is there a problem with Facebook?????
Need to fix app run like crap for taking to much space is complete BS.
Slow it says it expired b-4 you can even get started
Love it
Nunca me haba dado problema sta aplicacin y ahora se cierra cada vez que me meto.
Ever since I udated getting app to open is a pain in the Butt please fix this. I use Facebook to keep in touch with family. I'm a stockholder also. Not happy
Cool
Videos aren't playing properly. It goes to half way through then stops and after it stops, no more videos will play until I close the app.
Won't load my videos
Kio
I've been installing & uninstalling  Facebook app for almost a week now  still i cant sign in all I get is " setting up Facebook" & "Just a moment".
The force close always comes up and its very annoying so i rated the app as a 3 star.
App closes every time i click a feed.  Thank God for Twitter
I hate how this app basically forces you to install messenger if you want to text thought this app. And this is app is getting slower and it's taking up so much space, please fix this!!!
Its alright not good
super nice,,,
Good
I have an android phone. Since the last update, it is so slow that I can't even use it.
Doesn't ever wanna load. Please fix. Im sick of this crap
Great work and new fealing with android thanks , but need options to be offline for chat
Slow
Saya suka tapi bila bukak je x smpi 10 minutes dia tutup tros  Tolong repair kn ok
Update is slow and sucks
Since the update it takes forever to load,it always keep on setting up!! At the same time it takes massive space and the speed is so slow! deleting this app its rubbish!
Try to open many accounts but I can't every time tell me try later it's too bad
Humanbeing
Getting Friends world wide, share their                 feelings, comments express the freedom to live and enjoy their life with the help of this app
This game is really great!
Excellent app
New update has made it so I can't comment on posts or write on people's walls. I can't even go to people's profile's.  Would like it fixed! Can't click picures or video's either,  just shuts down. Are yoh planning on  fixing these problems?
nice
Need to bring back in app messaging, why would you remove features? Shouldn't make people use a separate app just to message people.
Why does facebook need to read my text messages and send out emails without me knowing. Deleted
Very slow opening. Slow overall.
Fast
It wont let me log in through the app, it says my password is incorrect but thats not a problem when I log in online

When you go to your own timeline to view past posts, there needs to be a show more option like when you view it on the web. Instead of showing only the top posts from the year.
Very nice
Cant log in someday post stuff i will rate later
Error loading news feed thats all I get everytime I open the app.
Its slow and un-up to date
Facebook is broken.  It sucks keeps closing my game apps.
Load of crap...it wont even open
Great
Its slow and everytime I click on a pic or link it never goes back to my original spot instead kicks me back to the beginning of all the threads!
Works great
Keep asking me for a code aproove. I desactivated it... really bad
Slow to lod
I REALLY don't like the permission allowing this app to send emails purporting to be *from me* to anyone, including contacts it finds in my address book.
same thing to.. its realy hard to load a pics.. try fix it.
Takes up over 120mb of space on my phone. Pictures in posts take forever to load. One year later most resent posts STILL not an option. Hard time navigating from Facebook to outside links. Can't be moved to SD card. It's endless.  I'm heading to Twitter / Instagram.
Ugly
its a short cut to taking your  biz
So laggy on my device when I'm scrolling page
Every time i try to open anything, it closes, this is my third time re installing the app and it has made no difference! Get it together guys, its beginning to get a little frustrating
12345678
Closes randomly on its own after the last update..please fix...very annoying :(
I love facebook thank you for making it
Honestly, i prefer use this app than other third-party app. I can access group and others by left swap. But i've quite long page load and must tap to reload few times before i want to see what i want. Im prety sure, its not bout my connection. Ive try with 2 different carriers and wi-fi, still same. Please make it light and load faster.
Edit -  much better now.
This app is treble since I update I try doing any thing on it and it crashes. Truly despondent in it used to be brilliant. I am thinking of leaving Facebook because of this I hope you fix it very soon.
Ok
Too big, too heavy, too slow
Yenilian Rodriguez
Since the update this app just closes whenever I try open it. Terrible
Its faster than the older version.
I have no space for it
Make it simple please...
It goes so slow now n kicks you off page back to fb icon all the time.
Rated
Great way to stay on touch with family and friends!
Every time I open the app it freezes.
Love how family is always here
Love it
Keeps showing me things from last week! Every time I refresh nothing happens. Randomly closes, freezes, and pops up when I haven't clicked on it. Please fix.
It seems pretty good to me
Sucks but I need it so I deal with it!!!! Every time this Ap d downloaded it slows my v phone... It makes it freeze... Got a moto g last night let's see....  So much better w moto g
Would have been 4 stars since all the basic functions work just fine. But "Turn off Notifications" option on posts is broken and sometimes I have to edit picture captions 2-3 times before it saves changes. MINUS 1 star further for removing Messages which worked perfectly fine on the original app! I'm BOYCOTTING FB Messenger simply on principle!
Best service
Hate it, I don't want another app which takes a lot of memory in my phone just to message people !!
Great
Facebooks sucks asssssssss
Since the date it constantly crashes on my tab3.
This app force me really.. :s
I love this app. It works perfect on any phone i have. I really like the calling yu can do it works so much better than any other calling app ive had. The pictures upload so fast its just perfect. The app runs so fast.
F****** update..useless to install.never ever seen most recent news feed..whats wrong with u guys..the app is getting worst n worst..whenever i go to most recent the app automatically shuts down..this app will never get 5 stars until it is fixed

Its so cool as a social network
Sohail
Just get a white screen on launch
Ajay kumar bhatt
Well it constantly closes on its own pics only show half the time and super slow to come up if it ever does.
Clicking on the notifications tab takes me to a random post rather than my notifications.
Can't delete comments etc. Please fix. No translation on posts from different languages either & no copy and paste function anymore
its good rly
You should make a option to confirm friend request in you notification panel on your phone.
The last two weeks it asked me every time for my password and since I updated it doesn't even open!!!!
It closes everytime i log out, it doesnt even let me log in back.
Every time I try to refresh it doesn't let me refresh it! And ita really starting to make me frustrated
Its to slow and cant see news feed gonna uninstall if it doesnt change soon!!!!!
I used to like facebook.  Now I can't stand using it because of the mobile app.  They layout got more clutter (not less) and they got rid of messenger.  So now I have to install another memory and battery hog that takes more bandwidth, just to get full function of facebook.  On top of that, if you get a message the  app tells you, but doesn't let you read it unless you install the app.  If I didn't use it to keep in touch with family, I would just delete all of Facebook all together!
The most recent update shuts down the app once I open it... What's happening???
Lol so.. Fn cool
Eats up way more battery than before
Takes up wayyyyy to much space
It's ok just keeps telling me my login email isn't correct. Other than that it's ok
App So big and so slow to load ..
Instsgram is way better
not enough memory in my phone. can you make the size is not too big?
Nice app but very slow
Very nice
App keeps freezing on my Samsung Note 3.  Have to keep rebooting my phone,  it's extremely irritating
Good
I liked it better before....can't u give folks a choice as to how they want to communicate?  Will up rating if this happens. Also takes up way TOO MUCH  space! Plus now we have to download Messenger too??? Give us a break. I'm just about ready to give up FB.
amazing
Did I mention awesome?
Can't even login
After the most recent update the app is not working properly. Every time it is launched I have to wait for setting up - it takes ages, and after that it shows a message that says that app had stopped working. I have reported it and for about a week there are no improvement! I uninstalled it and using browser for FB! It doesn't deserve a whole star, but I'm afraid there are no possibility to choose 0 stars! Philips Xenium W6500
This is important for me
K
Nothing to do only my faxes book
All i can do is open the app it freezes please fix. Anytime i leave news feed it shuts down.. Really  frustrating. The update 9/20 does not work fb shuts down immediately what the hell. 9/22 still crappy please fix or I'm done with this app. I've begged several times done with this app. Uninstalled  negative stars
Veri god
Have Facebook is good to use it add a friend about it from nick
I haven't updated the new version bc every time I do Facebook has messed it up even more!! Please fix the issues that when u post something or switch to messages or anything it starts you back all the way over to the top of the news feed!!! PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!!! IT'S RIDICULOUS! IM TIRED OF HAVING TO START OVER EVERY TIME I POST OR CHANGE SCREENS!!!
Cannot download photos
Honestly,how is it possible that with every single update you manage to make what was bad to start with even worse?do it right or just give up!if I could give MINUS stars I would!if I were you I'd sack my creative team and start again,Seriously..... don't bother updating this EVER again until you can actually do it PROPERLY!you've outdone yourselves, the worst app in the world is now almost unusable.
I'm Mohammed Ridwan from abuja nigeria.i like peace
Takes a while to load pictures. Annoying.
Okay I can only look at one picture, when im uploading a photo, than it grey's out and goes back to the original feed page... Pretty effing annoying. I cant look thru them. I have to go into my gallery and choose which one i like when im trying to upload more photos. I cant flick thru my pictures in the FB app.. Its been like this for months and its REEAALLY annoying.
So much space it takes up and goes so slow hate it.

Great
Ok
This really sucks I have to install an app to see my messages.
When I put emojis on a post they dissapear. Please fix this, I use emojis a lot & everytime I try to use them, I can't. Fix it for 5 stars. & not to mention how it takes up so much space! It kills my battery too! 
I mean it's Facebook. What more is there to say!
The new update has been shocking. It hardly ever loads anymore and if it does the app crashes.
Its bool
facebook
Since I've updated. It won't log out and won't let me log in half the time..fix it!!!
Pictures
Why did they have to go and make messenger manditory. Definitely uninstalled the app for good as soon as they stopped letting me use inbox since messenger was extremely annoying. Also the permissions you need to agree to to use the app are terrifying.
First off, Facebook doesn't care about it's users. This update sucks balls. How long do I have to wait for Facebook to set up? REALLY?!
This is the heaviest app ever. Even its updates are too heavy. The app is very very slow. Generally the app SUCKS. Uninstalling it would be the best solution.
Very bad and so slow
Two fucken slow
it's. okay
Getting notification mad late. Not cool. :(
Since the "improvements for reliability and speed," this has been painfully slow.  Also, absolutely slaughters battery life, like it within a couple hours.  Messenger is worse than useless.
Ever since the latest update, the app takes years to startup. And it even crashes afterwards.

Its very slow .. how can I get the old versions ??! .. help
Device keeps forceclosing apps when i try to look at others profiles on my samsung tab 3 10 inch tablet. Please fix

since i updated it.. it just got slower than the older version.... it lags and also exits unexpextedly..... i will give 5 stars if fixed... Thanks
Works great
Now  I don't need a computer
Horrible! Takes for ever to load!
If you click a weblink on the newsfeed the browser crashes. For a few days it sent me to a fb viewer but now wont work at all. Get it working before u update a billion peoples phones please! Also hate having to have Facebook messenger!! Such an intrusive app.
I get a notification that it's someone's birthday, I tap the notification, Facebook takes me to the birthdays page and the person it was notifying me about is not on the list. Facebook, you fail at notifications.
Why is this so crap. Crashes on aversge 5 times a day, and I've only been on it 4 times.
Cool and bad
Just love it
Loved it
That fake looking Ryan Gosling screenshot gets me every time.
Stupid programmers
This application sucks .. a lot of issues .. a lot of nonworking things .. always terminated without warning .. TOTALLY RUBBISH
What have you done ? When i updated it went way slower than it used to be , always not responding.

Helemaal klaar met dit schijt bedrijf. Waardeloze app, waardeloze website en waardeloze service. Nu stuurt dit bedrijf ook nog eens doodleuk je telefoonnummer naar Facebook. Ik wil mijn nummer niet op internet en al helemaal niet naar zo'n onbetrouwbaar bedrijf als Facebook. Misschien moet jullie bedrijfsleider maar eens vervangen door een volwassene.
It's nice that I hardly stop texting.
Since I updated this, I have being having issue logging in. I am rating u one star. Make corrections asap

Needs update!!! Fb not responding!!!!!!
I don't know why these people are writing negative comments this app is perfect. I use it on many devices and never had a problem.
Please
Lately I would try to use this app then it would automatcally shut off on me and take me back to the home screen of my tablet. I don't understand why this keeps happening. Please fix this asap.
(lg g3) can i give a zero??? ever since latest update my news feed wont update at all, same old posts for two days now with a beautiful spinning circle...... Repeat for two days, considering the size of this app u would think it would work properly.
No freezing, not a bit slow, just vanishes like it was never open shortly after I open it. Fix it or give us easy access to installing the app without these recent updates included.
Its a faster way for Facebook
When I got to message someone or go on a page, Facebook just decides that it will just turn off . Sort this out !
I'll change my rating if you fix this
It's decent this time around but whenever there's a link shared on my news feed, trying to open it always crashes the browser. Can't be 100% sure that it's Facebook causing the issue but all my other apps work fine with chrome.
Ok
Awesome. ..
facebook hvnt going good which is the really sad part
The app is good . works fine, but they are forcing me to download the fb messenger app to view messages which is horrible...in future try to make separate app for each options on Facebook, so that we can quit fb without hesitation...
When my fb app was updated it became so so so so so slowwwww...i'll give 0 star if there was an option for 0 star..before when u open fb it'll start loading right away but no there's this crap that says "setting up facebook" then "just a moment"...i can watch videos from the web w/out even waiting for it to buffer so this is not an internet connection issue...fix this fb team
Very good versions
I think ur are trying to make us walk away from the app
So bad app after updating it ..it sucks
Loved it
Keeps crashing on load screen, "one moment" comment
Crashes on Techno R7. Never get to open the app since d last update. Pls fix. Thanks

What is the point of appearing offline if they know you're online anyway via your last active minute number? I want to appear offline without people knowing I'm currently secretly on FB.
Good one.
Since the update, it wont open! Work fine before!! Now says "just a moment!!!!"

How does a company make their product  worse update by update,  yet always expects more money & surrendering of privacy from it's users?
Worst than before
Don't like this app. It keeps freezing and won't load news feed or let me see my notifications.  Have reported the prob so hopefully it gets fixed asap
since the update i'm having to force close all the time and then it's freezing my phone! If it's not fixed soon i'll be uninstalling
The app waisted my space so thst I ended up deleting five nights at freddy's STILL i love it

Took away messaging feature in this app and made it so you have to download the messaging app. There shouldn't be a need to download two apps. Could have just left the messaging feature in. App has also become terribly slow. Now I rather use a browser as it still lets you message people.

News feed wont update.
The new updated version has serious problems. It is super slow and does not log you off properly. When you try to log back on, it goes in to this continuous logging off mode because of not properly logging off from previous session. It then never gets through the log off mode so that you can log back in to the app. This app really stinks.
It takes forever to download it it sucks
I don't have to download this onto my new android to know its crap  was crap on the iphone, blackberry and its crap on here
Really good app to have
Very Good

Just won't open. I've tried to reinstall the app a few times but for some reason, it won't open.
This app is only good for family and friends. After that your life is out there for every sicko to see. It's a stalkers playground
What happen mark???
Title says it all. Crashes all the time and my Facebook contacts won't even show up or sync in/with my phone contacts anymore.

My phone died extraordinary fast today. I decided to look and my battery usage and the number one battery usage app was Facebook above 50% and second was "Android Service" of about 45% which is not an app I can control.  I was not on Facebook at all today. Killed my phone without being used. Get rid of the extra permissions Facebook! Now that I uninstalled this app my phone is not overheating and is charging faster.
Whats so great about telling everyone everything you guys need to b locked away in prison i think u use subliminal messages to keep people into it my girlfriend cant seem to leave it alone my final thought is for all of you to fuk off and die screw you facebook crew

Super fine new updates on face book
It consumed 40% of my battery in 1 hour without me even using it. Even if you force stop the app, it will start itself after some time.Don't download it!!!!
Ever since downloading this app my phone runs slow and lags especially when on fb it will stop and say facebook isnt responding fix it and it will be great!!!!!!!
Its great and I can't live without it lol

Why do we need to look at all photos in our phone to upload in fb? It would be much easier if we can browse the pics through the album..
Why can't you move this to SD card stupid app eats all of your phone memory why
Messaging is now a separate app. Both installed take 100Mb+ constant ram, take up too much battery and can't be stopped from running in the background.
New update was installed two days ago.  Yep, it sucks.  My individual notifications are one big pile of crap that you can't see but 4 or 5 of.  It constantly is blinking.   Just enough crap to suck your data and battery dry.  Nice screw up Facebook.   Whose bright idea was that?  And oh on mobile, as you are scrolling,  the screen reloads the page on you...Makes what you are doing kind of pointless in the first place!
When i click on a link, then try to go back to FB, it just sits on a gray page until i re-start my phone...  what have you done to what once was a wonderful app!!!
Fun....
Updated the app and my account is blocked what the fuckkk???

Lucky you, you get 1 star for a 0 star app slow, and why so much space needed?
Since the new upgrade it will not open. Just starts the news feed and then closes the app. Was fine before. ..

There should be an option for zero stars.... Slow as f*** and keeps freezing and shutting down my phone!!! . fix this crap and stop changing it .

Yet again the update has made this app worse...seems to be the norm every time you try to make it "better '.  So Much wrong with this!.Also i would like My newsfeed to be up to date and not show random stuff from friends 3 days ago!!! Uninstalled updates as the access to my phone and  the permissions requirements just scream  SPYING!! on everything on your phone! Do not trust.
Soooooo bad
Nice
Really should update to where I can decide for most recent or top stories not just top stories because I see things from two-three days after they post

Facebook downloader
When I download it . It takes too space on your phone. And i can't downlad that much apps. Fix it please. Thank you.
i lile this
Facebook plus open it
Read the EULA carefully, for the facebook app, and messenger...till I have control over what these apps are asking for, I have fewer interests in staying with facebook as it is no longer about networking, but more about advertising.  I hate being forcibly advertised to when I only care about the friends, and family aspect and keeping in touch.  App is a resource hog, refuse to download the messenger app as its even worse!
I love this app
The app constantly freezes and shuts with no offer to send a report.
It was so good because you can speak to your freinds
Can't even log in, next time you update the app make sure you get it right... uninstalling

I love it
Very nice apps for the connecting globle human

Too slow to upload... hate it..
Face watch
...it keeps on crashing almost every day when I also have the Facebook messenger app installed...
Not bad
IS THE BEST THANK YOU !
Not only does facebook app use too much data and disc space the video auto-play keeps turning itself on using up more data allowance.  It's not worth all the problems.  I'm not going to use it any more.
Yupie
Hate that you need to download messenger now smfh!!!
Faster and smartee

Anytime problem in logout time what happen?????
Screen goes to black...what happen..?
Can't cht properly its asking to download messenger thu fuckin app

I don't like the messenger app but this one is ok
Dont let me log in most the time bullshit app
This ap uses too much space on your phone. Just sucks it all up!
Plzz add copy paste option....
It used to be okay but it just gradually worse. It's so slow and lags like Hell.
All the same complaints as everyone else stated below.  I don't like the new Android app.
It keeps on crashing.. I still have a lot of memory space, I don't know why!
If you guys think I will start using messenger because of this update or whatever it is...!Get to know I won't because that will increase my Ram consumption and my battery usage! P.S. Get back that in app chat! -_-
Hart hart
I'm happy with it
As soon as I updated, I lost all email, phone and FB notifications from my 300+ friends. Account/notification editing on my phone or laptop makes zero difference, no matter how many times I've tried. I contacted FB? Zero help, no reply. Look, Facebook, I don't have all day to search every timeline to see how my friends all over the globe are doing. Just wanted updates of friends who had posted. Facebook, REALLY bad move.

I love it because I can talk with my friends, my family I love this app, tankyou
Lumping shares from one page together causes issues for the "Most Recent" feed. Very recent posts can get grouped with something from yesterday, causing it to be way down the news feed instead of near the top.
Pero aveces es demasiado lenta por eso no le pongo 5 estrellas. Lo dems si esta bien.
Good but not fast and not good serching
Wont even let me leave a message .I hate hate this new and BETTER app. Want old app back
Wow.... like wow! U know what u did wrong now fix it!

some times freezes.improve it to get more stars.
Even the buffering is inside it . how nice
Good
It won't even load to let me log in the pile of poo
I am seriously so irritated. Every time I make a status or share something & put emojis, they disappear after being posted. I have to edit the post for them to show. What gives? I've uninstalled then downloaded again & it didn't fix. Please find the problem & fix, it's so annoying.
Keeps freezing for past couple of months.-Samsung Galaxy S4
This app sucks. Well done Facebook people.
Frustratingly bad app - continually closes itself - this since you did the upgrade - NOT
Totally sucks!!! It doesn't have all the options. Even we can't chat!!! it uses a lot of memory and very very very slow!!! Battery drains very quickly!! Pictures looks blurred!!! Facebook failed!!! Sorry ;) :p

It really amaging.
I uninstalled this app. After the update it won't work....
takes up way too much space on my phone, add in the fact that we were forced to take on another app (messenger), i now have zero space on my phone. Please fix
This app used to be pretty good but with recent update it no longer loads pictures or videos, and will only refresh the feed once then it's the same status" until I close the app completely and restart it, app is terrible now
I like this application

Sort of awsome I connected with my friends
Taking so.much time to open.. every time setting up n then auto quit

Since updated... it is real slow ...

It's slower than snails screwing, it force closes constantly, pics don't load right, news feed jumps to wherever it wants to while scrolling through it, the list of problems goes on and on.  Stop trying to fix what isn't broken!!!!!!!
Crashes after update - deemed useless.

After the past few updates, the app crashes constantly. If I do anything more than read the news feed, it crashes. I think Facebook has outgrown it's ability to care about its users.
Its good..n fun
To still not have an android tablet ap is bizarre
Its ok kind of slow
I don't like it anymore... When i want to post something and than to add o mood or place or even tag friends appears "Facebook unfortunately stopped" what the hell ?!! Fix it!!

Staring last week my news feed, post, and pictures will not load. I thought it was because I needed to update the app. However I just updated the app and there has been no sign of improvement. I also noticed that I stopped getting notified when someone sends me a message. I use an ASUS MeMo pad
I am sooo happy. I feel alive again.
This is a very bad app. First of all it doesn't start up easily. It takes a lot of time and needs a big space. Rather use a browser to surf facebook. Useless app. I wanna rate it 0 or if possible in minus. #_Garbage_Full_App!!!
why does it have to access all my personal items
ok
Lovely
good
Unable to edit posts...The option to turn off notifications does not work. Also i am fed up of having to go to settings everytime i want recent posts. How hard can it be to have a default
It's  start with  30mp and it's   raise up to 60mp fix it and it's  very slow
I like this

But u need more improvement

Much better than the old one
Since last update this app has been preventing my phone from sleeping thus draining my battery. Over 53,000 wakeups in one day! Stopping the app does nothing, it just starts right back up. Uninstalled until this is fixed.

This app is overheating my phone very badly! Fix this and I will give 5 stars!
Always error when downloading can you  fixed it please
It's better than before and easy play better before.

This app takes so long to download ,I should have known it was  bad just by looking at the reviews):
Ok
The news feeds is too slow to update, its been an ages!
Please add a night mode.
The app was doing just fine for months then all of a sudden it keeps crashing. Needs to be fixed
Don't like to have to hit 'most recent' every time I get on this app.. really wish y'all wouldn't have messed with that :(
Phone runs terrible now and update is huge! Deleting and reinstalling. Hope it helps

Nice app..
Ye such me life jine ka mazza he
Waste of 2hours
Since the last update, my data has sky rocketed out the roof!!!!  What the heck is going on? ??   And yes, I reset the app settings and everything I need to do. But I dint know why cause I never had to do that before and now is using like 1.5 GB a month? !?!?! Wtf!!! Someone please help
Down landing it now
Facebook
Good apps.....
Nice
Click to go back or follow link. I'm tired of this popping up everything I click a link. It's really starting to get annoying that I have to take this extra step every single time I want to check out a link on Facebook. I'm getting really sick of this company. Everytime they make something about it better, they make something else twice as bad. How can a billion dollar company screw up an app consistently? Facebook honestly does not deserve the money we farm for them.
Pakso
What in the hell possessed  you to want to take up more of my memory for your stupid messaging app that would basically have access to every little thing in my phone. You had (key word there HAD) messaging already on there and you move it to an external app just because it might be a little bit faster. The app was fine with messaging on there, but you want to move it to an external app because you want access to everything on my phobe? I'm speaking for a lot of people here when I say not no but HELL NO!
Takes up too much space, all this Crap about the messages... Done.
Why would they need access to my text messages and phone calls. Bye bye Facebook
Facebook is getting worse come on guys I really don't want to uninstall for good but your updates are sh.......t it's lucky getting 1 star
Log
Everytime I open the Facebook app it just appear "just a moment" and after that it doesnt response so embarrasing pls. Fix it if i can just give it a 0 star -_-

On Samsung 10.1 Tab 3, the main crash/halt/dump comes when I'm viewing a post that's about to be magically jumped to the top of the list. Either way (crash,  or jump my view to the top), IT SUCKS!  You need to get smarter and fix your processes.

Slow on fast devices like m7  Sluggish and doesn't have tablet ui on 2014 g note 10.1  Now does not even show the same version on other devices and both are up to date according to Google play !!! I am taking my rating from 3 to 2 stars. Still 2 stars after the update
Zabardast
It's very slow
Photos take forever to load. -____-
Facebook i make update ..its running very slow & not opan now ..wt happan i dont know
Every once in a while, when I try and load the app it does this weird flashing like it's switching between multiple screens that are black and white. I wouldn't have an issue with this if it was once in a blue moon, but it's happened like 10 times today alone.                                                          Edit: in app browser is extremely frustrating.  It doesn't load very well, and I have to go to my Internet browser anyway to watch anything that involves a video player.
Awesome aap
This is so fuckin slow after I updated

I always receive late notifications. Like i'm going to receive it after 20 minutes or so. I updated my facebook just now and there's no changes in everything. Please fix it.
Superrrrtr
Hate all the changes and the inability to see recent updates that aren't three or more days old. I have no issue with the ads or promoted posts, but the fact that I can miss important family and friends events because Facebook decides what I should see is unacceptable.
world famous..
Used to be a great app, now its very slow, takes up a lot of memory and i dont like the new look of it.
Good but not stellar
Most of the time pics and videos don't load. Plz fix or I'm deleting!
Lampa
Great
Why do you keep make changes again n again, actually I know the secret. It's because you want other new edition phone to be sold
This app is so slow I couldn't even load so I uninstalled it and now its taking forever to download
facebook is dbest
Reduce the size of this app,i 'll give u better rating
Hate it! Bring back the older version. It takes forever to open the app and sometime it just won't work. Please please fix this.

So, tell me again why you guys need to listen in on my calls, read my text messages, access my camera, and my phone book? Invasion of privacy much? Bad move guys. You're making yourselves look like a bunch of spies. Give us our phones back, and just stick to what goes on on your site. Not our private lives outside of Spybook.
So nice
slow  .Why?
Doesn't load pictures or anything else for that matter. Very slow and frustrating. Thinking of removing...

Vry bad.... vry slw
Slows my phone down big time

Keeps shouting down on its own. I've installed and uninstalled a couple of times Zzz still nothing. Now it shows error 24 or some ish Zzz this the second time this has happened. Fix it please. Other than that its aight
It doesn't work at all! Previous release was really better to work with. I will remove it from my smartphone.
Since the last update the app crashed and has completely refused to open. What was in it???? I have tried to uninstall and re-install, still not working. Kindly fix the problem.
Sucks... too slow
what's wrong with this facebook?!?! i can't open it!!!! pandok!!!!!!
Eats battery!
Interesting
Too slow. 
After updating this app won't start it just continually tries to load sucking the life out of my phone. Thanks no more Facebook on my phone.
I cant reinstall it !!! Please fix this !!
I don't no what iam say
The Facebook is a so Slow.
Aaaa
Good but i've downloaded its ok but i've update it doesn't updating
Why on earth do you need 20 concepts for Facebook to be used as an app? I refuse to allow Big Brother into every single aspect of my life.
Fix This Please When I Update An I Log In Its So Slow Its Written Setting Up Facebook  Fix This Please Or This Will Be Your Fault If I Can't Chat Anymore My Friends In Facebook
Will give rating after i use the update!!
It's good
I like it. It helps u get intouch with old friends
The app lags so much! There's no option to filter the newsfeed. When I'm on my profile my name and another word overlap each other. Constantly crashes as well 
Became slow, until not respodings. Tahi.
Its cool
Won't stay open for even 5 minutes than shuts off!
Facebook does not sync on androidone device....micromax
I just love it  good app
Amazing
h
When i get on it, it kicks me off saying it has stopped or after 10 mins of being on it, it kicks me off again. When I'm on messenger it kicked me off if the chat box after 3-4 seconds but with out I can talk to people with out for awhile
The app has so much update. It's one of the largest app on my cellphone. It is because of update. But anyway it is a good app and it's easy to use,so i will rate you four stars
This is my fe rest
You should use your own browser inside facebook app just like facebook for ios, should not go to another app when clicking on a link inside facebook.
Ok
Fix
Nyc.
Ft bfn ugh duff
Hey fix that most recent coming up in settings and it wanted to be in news feed left side only not in right side so fix it as fast as u can....otherwise worlds most worst app and website ...... and please add full conversation email or backup and can be retore or can be share to someone....
I have an xperia Z2 and I couldn't photo comment.. But after this update I can...loved it... Lol don't update after this
Nice application you communicate your friend any time
Slow
Cannot share post  via private message like iphone

When will this be an option?
Nice
Siiplah
I think so it will be fast
Slow......
can't the mobile app allow users to attach files? Even FB Messenger crashes when I try to send files. disappointing.
WELL I HATE THE BUGS ON APP!!
Do you know the difference between moment and forever ? Your app says "just a moment" but it took forever to load ?! WTF . ! You update it but it became worst than i thought !
Its good
Khan
The previous version was far better than that.Cannot log out or in.
Good bit requires more boot up speed
Since a current update my Facebook hasn't been letting me in. It says loading, setting up and then goes back to home screen. I run virus scans and delete junk files, so that isn't it. Please fix the problem.
Like
This app sucks
After the update worst things happened .unistalled
Good
the size is too big! i have only 1 app in this phone but fb still wont be opened because there is no enough storage
This app always closed by itself and doesn't work properly.                                      Plz check it and solve the problem
Better
Every second time or so the app is stuck at "setting up facebook" or "Just a moment please" for several minutes before it opens (often enough it doesn't continue from there at all, just eating up battery). Can't see a pattern. Sometimes works, more often doesn't. WTF? Fix it. It used to work more or less satisfactorily.
Was working fine till the last 3 days...now I can't get on...fix it NOW!!!
Why I cannot download this app. ??
Can't see the most recent posts! Service is super slow ! Stop in the middle of my searching through posts, just a complete black screen ! Facebook needs to be fix a lot !
This app sucks. It seems like every other day it just stops working and freezes up. It's not my phone  either because no other apps do this.
Facbook is may laief
Requires too much phone space
Sana

Sluggish and crashes frequently. Sheesh.
Always hang
Error  found...
The new app design is terrible. Please change it back.
I have a cubot x6 and the app was working fine before the last update. Now it crashes the second i click on the icon. Just leave well alone !
Open Facebook and it refreshes then closes for the last 2 days. I can log in from regular site on my phone with no problem. Please fix! Lg g3
Since i updated this apps its gone so slow.....
Better one
Recently updated, and now it is constantly crashing. Especially when I want to open a link to the internet

Tooo slow
Doesnt even load. Waste of space. Uninstall button. Poof.
The Facebook app closes automatically each time i click on any feed. I have tried uninstalling it and installed couple of times but is the same. If anyone has any suggestions please help.  I am not able to check facebook at all.
Awesome

Worst  app  ever
Yes
Loved it
Used to work fine until the last update& now the app won't even open! I've tried uninstalling & reinstalling! Yet still nothing! Has this happened to anyone else?
The best way to keep in contact with the family and friends
Owsome!
I like it better than going online and using it
VERY Slow. Not all pictures appear eventhough you keep on tapping on refresh. What happened?
I was born with facebook in my veins...And Mark you rocks.!!!

Very very good app
I don't like it
Please fix this app. May phone getting slow and may battery to much drain, and update to much big files....  If you fix it i will give may precious 5stars
Enormous size
Good
Thanks
Super slow.
The update sucks it keeps shutting down. Make it work again.
It appears that only negative people leave feedback on something that is free, I admit the download is huge but that's ok it will eventually finish and I am thankful to Facebook for their program.
Loved this app UNTIL i upgraded now it closes down when I try to check notifications etc. Please fix this problem as I cant use Facebook on my tablet anymore - very frustrating :(
Nice
This latest update is horrible. It takes up so much space (even when switched to sd card) that my phone shuts down when I try to open it. On top of that if it doesn't shut down, facebook refuses to open. It's said "setting up facebook" for 25 minutes! I can't even log in. Five of my friends have cancelled their accounts on FB because of it. Fix it asap please. For now I'm recommending all my friends to get rid of it altogether
Why is it slow? Fixed it. So many users of it are angry with this app! Fixed it plss.
It's the best
It keeps shutting down everytime i try to look at a pic, share a post or update my information.

UsmanNawawi
sooooooo slowwwwww
Can't load my friend's profile pic, posted pic and uploaded pic after the update or even download again this app.Luckily, it doesn't affect my chat among my friends.
It is very slow to load videos pics hahahahhaha
facebook for android is pretty poor, 99% you will be watching the loading spinner. Crashes are common.  Sometimes I think a carrier pigeon would be quicker.  and who's given it all these stars? even when its working and finally loaded  its not much cop, really it isn't.  this not the best Facebook app - unfortunately its the only facebook app. Old review - better but still not much cop. 1 star as it messages notifications but doesn't read them. Crap.
facebook is the best
Since the last update the application is not working. It shows the facebook logo and then it crashes. I tried uninstall and reinstall but nothing. I m not going to waste more time with this. Its pitty but its not up to me
Owsm
Good
It's so excellent .
After update keeps force closeing
Gossip crap site!
Facebook
Also, it would be better if we can share pics directly from fb to other apps like WhatsApp.
L
App very slow download
Awful! Doesn't open at all! I resisted downloading the application for a long time (privacy issues) and when I finally decided to download it, it simply doesn't work. EPIC FAIL!
I don't know why "top stories" is still the default! And now, when I leave "most recent" to check my notifications, I have to reload "most recent" to view them again but from the start. This does not save my data in the slightest. Facebook app, you're getting more and more frustrating every update! Please, listen to your consumers! Make "most recent" the default, for crying out loud!!!
Ever since I updated this app. It have not been able to access it. Please this problem should be rectified before I can give a better rating
Wala rin
Of all the nonsense you've churned out referring to as updates... This is the worst of them all. I wish there was 0 stars.
Don't like ds
App is good, but after update app crashes when ever I open
Cat get app to open
Im happy in this application

I hate this update still.  Now it wont even show anything at all. Im better off using the browser until this gets fixed. It says no posts.
Good app

Click on anything and it shuts down. Frustrating.

Seriously what's going on with this latest update? Nothing is working right and the widget is completely broken.
Wish that pages references would also be opened in app itself without using other browser
I love it this apppp

After last update always crashes at launch on Google Nexus S. Can't use Facebook anymore. App has always been memory hogging, sluggish and battery consuming. I'm considering doing like my friends and simply use the mobile interface of their website, as the app has always given more troubles than advantages.
The latest update is not stable, hangs when open application.
Very good
Doesn't load properly and always crashes in the middle of scrolling the newsfeed 
Super
Haha lag xD
Good when it comes to uploading
Good apps

It's slow and everytime i try to post a comment, it fails. And i still hate the fact that I have to download yet another app to read my messages on FB.
I have to use my Web browser in my phone to access fb. It's been like this for months now ... Very frustrating!
Just follow dope585 on the gram
Improve ur app always not responding when i log in n log out. Poor app.
New update? Why? It was working, now it's either error messages, blank screen or closing every time I try and use it. It's also ruining other apps which for some reason use it - scrabble, ruzzle adventure to name a couple.
Will not allow me to change/upload profile pic.
Super
Bueno.
New update  sucks....It is.  Taking a lot of internal memory.. Around 100 mb... :@
New version is so slow 
Frequent errors and pictures are not loading
Berbat bi uygulama kesinlikle gelistirilmesi gerekiyorr
Hate the fact I have to use a separate view to see things in time order,  and when I do I lose the notifications bar. Why are you removing good features??
I can't logout! It keeps stalling!

So coool
it's not loaded the pictures perfectly, every time it's stuck after 15 pictures or videos or any media, and i have to force stop the program to load more media on my htc one
Fix the news feed... Why are you seeing stuff that ppl posted on Sunday and it's Wednesday that is annoying! It loads slow!
Get rid of built in browser. IT DOESN'T WORK. I can no longer get rid of adverts or as I call them spam posts and obviously get rid of messenger. I refuse point blank to install such bloatware. It's getting to the stage where I'm considering leaving Facebook.
I end up having to delete loads of things from my phone to download facebook, and then when its downloaded it runs so slow :/ what happens to the old simple facebook

Something happened during the last update. I can't click on comments or pictures. Every time I do the app closes and takes me back to my home page. The app is working fine on my Galaxie Note 2.
This app sucks... it won't let me log in Most of the time...
Enough is enough
Since the update FB doesn't load a message keeps telling me is not responding ........ uninstalled until sorted!!
Nice

It takes up to 10 minutes for the Log In screen to pop up.. then an additional 20 minutes for the news feed to load.
I love facebook very much.facebook is nice
Please fix
Its quite nice...
Its a good app, I especially liked the inbox which worked perfectly for me. Unfortunately you're not able to do that any more and have to download another application to simply read messages. Not only that but the new messenger app has no way of turning off notifications, so you'd better learn enjoy getting notifications about messages on facebook! Disgraceful app building behaviour, it should be "illegal".
Super
V.good

Latest and updated this facebook app is backdated....

This app is gud but not too gud becoz sum tym it is hanged nd in this others status r also seen thats gud although forget all the dislyk nd focus on lyksssss dn its is awesum i lyk this app it is easy to update aur status
After my last update, early this afternoon. What I experienced ALWAYS was (if I could sent a photo, I would). Everytime I open the app it always say like this "Setting up facebook" and after a glimpse, this appears "Just a moment." I have to wait another couple of minutes before I can use it formally. But the worst is when I'm using (enjoying) it already, it says "Facebook isn't responding. Do you want to close it?   Yes              No" What happen, Facebook? Hello? Yow! And I have to use the browser. :-(
Should of left messages way it was, don't like going to internet just to email a friend, and don't like messenger app.
Photos won't upload again...
Bad
Facebook comes happy ness

Really good
Is having a good look But runs vry slw on 3G networks even! Otherwise good!
It sucks
i cant even open the app after updating it...
The newest update i can't even log-in(without a error message) then when i do get logged in, it will NOT log off! Very frustrating i have figure out ways around ALL the error messages!
The update has messed everything up please FIX!! Half the time it won't even load!!
Innovative..... :-)
This app sucks major balls it took me an hour just to get to the actual app get together people
The app won't load anything!  It stops working when you first click on it! 0 stars
How about when you update its something your users want/like? I want recent posts not crap from days ago. Recent posts need to be easier to get to. Better but still sucks compared to the old version. Likes won't stay. Privacy setting won't change on posts. Soo many glitches. Pay your app employees more! Then maybe it will work right. New update did nothing different. All the same crap just added more crap to my phones memory. New update changed nothing. Again.
good
it keeps hang and slow.always shows Facebook do not respond. Really bad. 0 star.
more followers
Wonderful
So slow. Completely sucks.
Can't tell you how many family members I have found. Happy happy!
This is by for the worst update in the history of updates. It doesn't refresh, It doesn't clear notifications, it's slower than cold molasses. News feed is all jacked up. I see updates from yesterday.
Hard to love
It doesn't notify me anymore fix please since I update it it's so slow please fix now
I don't want to use this app anymore......can't chat without messenger..

News feed keeps jumping whenever I try to click on a post. Screenshotting also closes the app.  Can't view recent posts, only top posts...
Good for chatting
Terribly slow, missing most recent status option or very difficult to find, poor to navigate. If it's not broke, don't fix it.
Too slow , loading is slow and fails to log me in ! Plz fix it ??
It's totally abusing
Shove your messenger down your Donkey( meaning of that with out the Jack )  some random person messaged Me and I can't message them back YOUR RETARTED AND I HATE YOUR SITE  . hated the app it won't let me just have messenger.  Fast is so much better....

Hate the update. But the app takes more memory. Reduce its size. Unable to add the nearby location.
Cool apps
Every since the last update, Facebook takes forever to load! App has gotten slow as hell!! I have to turn my phone off and back on for Facebook to load and sometimes that doesn't help!!!! Please Fix!!!
very slow and it sucks!
Ever since I updated this app, my phone ALWAYS force closes Facebook. I literally can't even check my news feed without it force closing and being slow as hell. Fix this. I rate it ZERO stars, but that's not an option on here.
All of a sudden it just closes.  Many times per day.  Other than that, it's good
As soon as I click on the app it goes black and white black and white over and over
It freezes somewhat frequently, and likes to pick which of your "recent stories" it wants to show. If I used my laptop regularly, I wouldn't even bother keeping the app. Unfortunately, as my tablet is my main form of communication, I will put up with it for now
favelous
If best i will give 5 star leter.
Evey time i open the app im only on literally 2sec and it closes and go to my home screen. .Please fix

New update will not load.
Occupied too much of storage memory
Worst app ever...
Its good and best is it is the most popular among all generations ...
Its a good app. Still needs a few improvements. I really don't like the fact that I need a separate app for messages.
Cute
I hate dis app
Good,
Dont even waste your time down loading it
Facebook is more of a Hassel than its worth
This app and the messanger app Is always saying I'm on when I'm not. And I'm not the only one. My boyfriend is laying next to me snoring ( and has been for the last 2 hours) And its saying he's active now! The app isn't on on phone or computer so why!!? PLEASE FIX!!!
Since the new update if I tap on the picture in my newsfeed I can't swipe to the next picture. Even if I go to the facebook page I still can't swipe from picture to picture. Also facebook freezes and restarts my phone by itself. Please fix it!!!!
My brother is  permissipn to use fb
Since this latest update this app is super slow and doesn't load my notifications...completely sucks!!!!
Takes forever to log in and out...
Pretty good
Good apps
Thandiwe ndlovu
I never had any problems with the app before but after it updated it's constantly freezing.   I can exit the app and close it out but when I go back into it it's still froze.  Only way to fix it is to restart my phone.   It's becoming a real problem for me
poor fb ur so very slow.change your apps. very slow but very big MB .  :(
how do we upload a photo we previously uploaded without losing the likes and comments???
Has became stupid! Can't do anything anymore! Slow! Keeps telling I have notifications and I dont!

App closes by itself. I only geton fb for a few seconds then it closes. Its annoying!
Update is very slow page does not open it takes more tym

Half the time I try to get on it tells me 'Facebook has stopped working' and shuts down. And it takes longer to upload pics and vids. Please fix.
It is disappointing me...atleast because it crash od force stop all the time plz fixed it
Since the new update the app wants to close on its own when ever it wants or when i click on a link. Please fix this
I cant open it sometimes, its always saying setting up,
Videos don't load slower than a dead snail. Only lets me log in when it wants. Hate it
How do I remove this photo?

Very clear sound
Nice apps
Every time I scroll down a lot to read older updates on my news feed, it forces me to go all the way back to the top of my news feed. Can't even read the updates I want to because of the frustration
Most ridiculous and gigantic app! Sluggish, and WTH did you do to the newsfeed?! Why is it you all think your way is better than what your USERS ask for? Between this and the monstrosity Message app, I think I may be permanently Twitter bound if something isn't fixed...the CORRECT way!

Every time I go into app on my samsung tab 3 it shuts down...i'm getting so feed up with it!
This recent update has the app lagging so much please fix
Nice
Facebook cannot be downlod.
thnx for this app
This app constantly freezes and closes on me when I do anything with it.  Scrolling,  commenting,  posting,  pretty much anything you would want to do on fb is useless on my samsung galaxy.   Fb needs to get this fixed soon or I am uninstalling for good.
Good
Open the app, start to scroll then gray screen then the app closes. Only start doing it when i upgraded the app.
So fast
Nothing but drama
See above :-(
It's very slow to open or load photos and sometimes it will go black and it will close I can't do anything
Keeps me busy
Cant do anything. Deleting Facebook all together
Not HAPPY at all. Very disappointed!
SERIOUSLY?!  Why do I now have to go even farther down the far right tab to find most recent?  I DO NOT WANT HAVE TO READ STUFF I HAVE ALREADY READ 2-3 DAYS AGO!  I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SET MOST RECENT AS A DEFAULT!  Can you not for the love listen to your users?  I like to see EVERYTHING my friends post not just what FB thinks I want to see.  And if there is a particular friend I really don't care to see their posts I can unfollow them so I don't need you to do the filtering for me.
It isn't letting me log in because I have a 'sticker error' I'll change my rating if you fix it. Please and thank you.
nice
The app is very slow at loading pictures. The pictures work fine when I'm on the website.
Keep up the good work guys (y)
It
App is no longer convenient now that messenger is separate. Plus, this app I notice it uses a lot of battery power. Even when I use a task killer to save power, it comes back on. App should stay off officially when we dont want it. Updating review to 2 stars cause this app is starting to take too much space.
Every time I open this app it crashes or shuts down by itself. Thisis so annoying...Do I need to uninstall this mess?
Really cool;)
Good
Good
"Error longing in" are you serious you log me out and then you don't let me in
It cool but take too long to load
good.
to slow and its always hunging up so dissappointed
It's so easy to build up for new friendship.
App does not work very good. App closes on it's own. Does not log out properly. I have to go to app settings and clear cache and also data in order to log out/in. Please fix!!!
Force close constantly.  Fix the force close. Hard to use because of it.
dammmn slow loading....refresh takes forever
like remov Aguthu Ang Agudhu
Not useful
It is best to compare when we use fb on normal browser....
Because. It keeps closing.....  but I guess. That's all hehehehe 
The best
Love it
I like to massage you
Sending requests i never sent. But then not allowing me to add people i want too. Gates you in a circle of closest contacts on ur feed. And nothing more...invasion of privacy. Not to mention the glitches. Lagging. And slow A@! Loading..
Quick
Won't play most videos, locks up, very messed up down grade. Google Nexus 7... Fire that sloppy programmer.
Takes soooo looong to refresh the news feed!
Awesome
Unnecessarily large app size and its still slow. Menu layout and design of the mobile site is far better.

This application is so slow and hopeless after the last update..
Loved it
CRAAAASHHH!
Won't download
Constantly crashes and force closes....I cant use it on my tablet at all and will be removing it from my phone if not fixed soon.
The update is horrific. No option to set the news feed as most recent instead of "Top Stories". Awful.
Why I can't log in to facebook and why invalid package
PLEASE RESPOND to my problems I report
Agarcia
Usaha@doa
Remove the camera addition and 1 of the messenger's.. Its pointless and I am never using them, make them as apps

Poo lol
I Really Love Facebook
Turn off notification for post doesn't work
What the heck is going on, please fix this crap!
Thank u for freezing my phone and s**king D ..... Cough cough choke on it
After the last update, facebook became harder to open and loading of the software. So its now became uneasy to use it.
Can't see the Korean Friends' in suggestion/people I may know.    Please fix my facebook app. Thank you so much!  Thanks!
Nice

I don't want it. Period. Let me send messages the way I always have.
Could be improved
Wonderful fast updates
Still lacks the copy paste option.
Older version
Unable to connect with the game I playing with candy crush
It needs custom privacy so I can choose who can see my posts. Facebook you're really slacking, please fix this you were this close getting 5 stars.      Update------ why was the advanced search removed? I like searching for people around my area, it was a good feauture. Facebook is getting more bad rep.
Crappy
It says insufficient storage but i have NO apps, i just took this phone out of the package!
I don't want to see "top stories". Period!  Change it so that I only see my most recent.
Interesting
Primarily because of the inability to send private messages since fb began requiring android users to download a separate messaging app.
GOOD
Cool
Since ive updated this app it gone so slow and it made my phone hang all the time and all other apps are affected..
Yes
Great!
Problems with connections
Love to text my friends and see what people post

Ok
Es lo mejor
Kool
Great way to contact Love One's and  friends I love the Facebook App
Finally uninstalled and good riddance to the messenger prompt.  Up yours FB, you don't dictate the market!
I have been able to find friends and family and we speak everyday. Via the web.
Work's perfectly on my phone! Love it.
It needs to load faster
Facebook app crashes all the time now that my samsung galaxy tablet 3 updated to 4.4.2
Amazing app!
and my contacts online list is not updating anymore... all of my contacts haven't been online in 2d. What?! No way! Lol   Please fix it!
Slow Uploading
I can't even open it half the Time an if it does it just closes by iT self Lol its jus us less!!!!
I need help on my facebook today
This app sucks!! Ridiculously slow loading and then immediately kicks me out. UNINSTALLED!!
I cannot download this because it takes too long and my phone ends up shutting down
Move it or loose it!!!!!
jupiterMX
jackieleh

Ever since I updated it it stops working and don't open
Not goods5
Mine also closes when i try to share, post comment ! On both my tablets ! Get it together !!
something went wrong?? before it was gudgeon now its horrible.... please fix it.
Slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww and cannt download video form it. last one is v.goooood .
Like if if my android wouldn't shut den as much
My everything
The new update makes the news feed scroll very slow, brings me back to the begining randomly so I have to re-scroll through everything I've already patiently waited to load. Videos play automatically without sound so that's nice, but when I click to view the video sound and video lasts for 15sec. than the picture freezes sound continues than everything freezes video says there's an error. Hit my back button no response than goes back to my home page where I must get back into facebook and scroll from start
Less glitchey unlike my tablet one this one should of came with it
Mahu main.
Very slowly
The app is messed up log in facebook next thing it closes its messed up needs fixed because nobody can not use this app
New update kills the battery on my phone way too fast, needs a fix ASAP
Why can't we watch the videos I've uploaded?
Keeps crashing...very frusrated
I love this app.
Every time I click on a pic or post the app closes.

Good app
Not much bad
Since the last uodate app just crashes all the time it is a total waste of  time.
Awesome
I don't even know what the latest update has done since when i click on the icon it just goes to a loading screen and says "just a moment" for ages and won't even load. Completely pointless.
App z super Bt take to much time to upload photos
fACEBOOK
How many times do I have to click unlike or unfollow until the app stops showing me those pages? Its getting really annoying!
Guud and more improvement..but something still lagging and i think need to be mpre smooth or resize the apps...so the more 'light' for mobile devices
always force closing on galaxynote10.1...please fix
But gets worse with each update. Click on a link then going back to fb and the news feed is back at the top. You can only watched videos on this app's video player, which gives you little control over the video. Defaults back to top stories everytime. And now the most recent news feed has been moved way down the bottom of the feeds page! I often just give up and use my computer instead if I'm at home.
I have no problems with the app, fast and responsive.  I see others having problems, maybe they should go to their cell phone provider and see if there is something wrong with the settings.
Dont like it needs new up date
Facebook keep force closing and freezing when I scroll too fast. Just started after the latest update..too aggravated
Its kinda slow but i still love it
Very good apps
Facebook
This app is now soooo big and loads slower I hate this!
I loved it
It loads to slow, it closes out automatically and it freezes...this new fb update is the worst.
K
Since update it keeps showing problems downloading.
This let's me communicate  and connect with my friends and family
This app is a memory hog! Slows down my device. Pls make this app a bit more lighter for our device to run this smoothly.
It always reminded me if nonexistent notification
Sucks
This last update is beyond bad. Freezes all the time, can't view messages, and even more of a pain in the butt to get to most recent feed. Why isn't that just automatically what it is when you open it. I don't need to see 4 day old crap at the top of my feed.
Plzzz massangr connect to fackbook on mobile
Nce
Closes automatically by itself or freezes up and thw shuts down. Being dumb.
Sucks for note3
Why is the app not opening after update?
Connecting with my love ones!
I finally got to re - download the facebook app and everytime I click on the  fb icon, it automatically takes me back to my home screen.   On my fb status widget, its blank.  One star from me until this is fixed.
Nice
A lot of pics don't show up and this app is just terrible. Takes up too much room. Takes forever to load. Doesn't really deserve any stars...
Too big n slow
pls fix it because it slow respon and always show not responding
Since the last time this app was updated, I have had nothing but problems with it. Fix it!
s1681@.
Excellent
The best app
I like it a lot!! Ya dig
You need access to my cell history and data access!!! I don't think so. No more FB. Off limits.
Since update I can't log in and use... Even cleared cache and uninstalled and redownloaded with no change... Whatever!!
Too slow and take a lot of space on memory...
Great App!
I am fail to understand why facebook app has been increased in size. Big problem now i am unable to use fb. Please reduce the size of fb app...
Extremely laggy. Doesn't work. Needs to be fixed
Nice
Awesome
Since the most recent update it doesn't open all the time and when it does it takes so long to load and usually freezes shortly afterward.
Very worst this app very slow to open & new status
Best
This app keeps crashing on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1.  Going to the website seems to work fine though.
Easy to meet friends
Facebook
Awes
Saikia
App so big and slow loading
Must have the best
I hate it because sntch everything
Interesting
Had to change password because it said it was wrong. Got in once then told me wrong password again. Changed again, same results. Sent email, no response.   Just tried changing password again but won't take code you sent me. This thing is a joke. Also responded to new email I sent by saying we can't respond to individual emails.
Saying this app is good,  is like saying Treyarch makes a video game that doesn't suck.
Always been a fan of Facebook
Exelent work
Update needed....cant read comments.  Have to scroll back forever to view.
Even though, it's simplified and very awesome UI but it just like a memory disaster for my Xperia.

K
If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Updates from 3-4 days ago?  This is ridiculous.
Let's not even bring up the shady ethics of Facebook... This app was bad and the latest update made it worse. I'm not entirely sure how bad it is because I can't seem to be able to open the app most of the time. Burn this.
Apps
The app freezes and crashes continuously. It will not load properly and most of the time the videos will play sound but no picture.
Awsome
Every time you change this app it's for the worse, not better !! I wonder if the techie 's who design this software really use it, because they're ruining it !! We use it less & less now ! It used to be fun ... now we check it out every once in awhile  rather then every day, or when we load pictures. Facebook needs to get it together again.
huhuhu...
Very good app
The fucking thing crashes every 5 fucking seconds. Extremely annoying and makes the app almost unusable
Every update is worse than the other. Pure s**t.
No good app
Very nice
Pura mamada!!!! What happened to facebook?? Its so slowwww 
I love it pusit pancit
Owesome
Feed should default to most recent. This gets more and more difficult with each release. Done with Facebook.
Great
So bummed got a new phone reinstalled Facebook application and it rarely works. Will not load pictures on news feed.
Fb performance is very poor and disappointing. Always not responding and stopped.
Can't view much since this last update, please fix
Soo, This app sucks It doesnt work Half of the time and barely responds
It good
Love the snow.
Pic msg even news feed extremely slow
Nice app
Please support city ville game in android.. All peoples waiting this new update. Thanks team
It is getting worse and worse. My news feed will no longer display any photos or videos, eveb after all the uninstalling.
get worst after update it, i cant comments on photos.  im using galaxy s2.
Doesn't load and show all my notifications. Still battery draining.
It takes up a lot of space -.-
Stupid app. No messenger need a sperate app for that. Who decided that instead of 1 nice convenient do all app they needed sperate apps that require sperate downloads just so they can eventually turn messenger into Facebook e-mail? "News" feed is full of old, stale information unable to change it to get most recent posts. Ridiculous permissions needed, why do they need access to my camera? Just stupid I'll check my Facebook from my phones browser from now on and they can keep their junk app. Uninstalling.
Every two minutes it shuts down and says FB is not responding! Lame..
Android 4.4
Finally functional version.
Nice
Everytime i click on my personal news, events, pictures, friends' profiles, or messages, the Facebook app shuts off and i have to open the app again. It has happened everutime ever since I updated the app. Please fix this Facebook or else i will post about this defect on Facebook!
Awesome
its ok this time
Explanations
best of the best
Good
I am having problems with FB kicking me out.  I than have to start all over.  Again and again.  Help needed but nothing so far!
Ever since i updated it and try to get in it foreclosures very irritating problem needs to be fixed
Privacy isn't an issue with Facebook.
Cool bruhh
by Chay Boy
Can't connect to candy crush !!! Making me mad !!!!
I like my privacy too much to install this app. There is no need for someone else to have that much access to my phone.
Please fix this problem. I have a Galaxy Tablet 3.
Down load app
like it
Dont want to download Facebook to have to turn around and download messenger to talk to someone taking upp too much space in my phone
It seems that this app does nothing but crash if i navigate away from my main feed. It is practically worthless now. Fix it please.
It doesn't load photos. I get some but not nearly all. Will change rating if fixed
The app changes to much
grat app
It does not work on my Samsung Galaxy tablet since the last upgrade.  So frustrating!
Stupid things keep freezing
Facebook is litterly getting worse by the day. I hate the messenger app. You really should have left the message part on our Facebook alone. I don't want another unneeded app sucking up my GB life. Please fix all this crap!
Most recent Most recent Most recent Most recent Most recent Most recent Most recent Most recent is better than top stories.
Nearby events !?!??
Very slow! Please fix this.
Take aleast two minutes to log in and atleast half that too log out please fix all remaining bus its getting really annoying.
You Guys Should Let Us Change The Color Of Facebook , Give Us Options On Which Color We Want Our Facebook To Be. That Would Make It Better. Other Than That I LOVE This App.
Cool app let's me connect to my old friend s
Great
Cool
I love Facebook :) but needs an dislike button
Facebook
I get to talk to friends and family
Can't c tru third party pfofile. Cant link to some game
Day 6 of not being able to use the app! Seems like I'm not alone!
It the most fun thing to do chat play games
Can not comment on any post. Please fix!
I hate massager
I really hate the new update. I cannot get back to the home page on the app after I click on a picture. The picture just stays full screen and is very annoying. I have to restart the phone just to get back to the home page. Change this annoying feature back to the previous update. Thanks
Nice

Sync and notifications turned off and it still drained the battery very fast.
You're getting greedy, and it's making my interactions annoying. I hate the news feed, I miss a lot of time sensitive stuff.
Last 5 have been profusely bad. Freezes and crashes
Great
Please make it better
Hate the fact when I am reading something the darn thing changes or goes automatically back up to the top or loads things from months earlier.  They need to get their app straighten out where it works correctly.
Thanks
Luvd it thou its got few setbacks
I dont need both apps I barely use my facebook app anyways now i need 2 on my phone i might as well just log into it from my browser you assholes
Facebook
Wont let me dowload it at all, it is getting really annoying
Too slow
Dose not work need lots more free space even tho its installed on my sd card and I have 2gig left need a older Facebook app to work can't uninstall updates just the app something needs to be done about this

Still using antiquated (all of 17 month old) Samsung Galaxy Ace which even with Google Play Services uninstalled is now really struggling to run the FB app. Good though it is, downloading and installing v18 virtually kills available memory ... any bigger and it simply couldn't run. We shouldn't be forced to acquire high end phones just to use a basic app like this.
I love to use my facebook.but now i cant open.please update for me.tnx
Stop trying to force the messenger app...and generally you suck
Since i dowloaded messanger i get no notifications on the notification bar on my phone and no notification ringtone. And dont tell me to reload or reset my phone cause that didnt help. Costomer service is no help and wont respond!!
It keeps crashing on my Samsung galaxy tab s3
Luv it
When i downloaded the update the app stops freakin workin
Since the upgrade it closes out if i try to do anything :(
Love
K
Its seems a bit slow!
If I had a penny for every single time this app has force closed on me I would be richer than Mark Kykerberg. Fire your app designer.
Its alright
Garbage
Lag lag lag
M
Nice
Facebook
google play wont allow me to use it comes up with server error what can i do
So slow
Nice fb
Podi
Best social site ever.
I love it  so much
Please fix your video compatibility cant play video on 4.2.2 only sound is available
It's trash..  so sad..
You can't even open the app anymore it just takes you back to your homepage on your phone. Can't believe facebook developers actually think this is a good thing because it's been fucked up for days now. Back to twitter I go!
Absolute f*%**ing s#@t. Stop fiddling.... It was fine six months ago you inbred idiots.
Are going to make me install your sh**y message app on my phone? Really. I would rather user the browser on my phone rather of doing that.
New inbuilt browser is a bit of a nuissance preferred reading links on chrome and YouTube videos used to launch YouTube straight off the bat.
Love it so much
Constantly closes while im scrolling thru feed!
Awesome
Latest version just crashes upon opening.....needs another update
The app is good enough itself when it works, but it always starts glitching out. Stops responding, won't scroll correctly or open pictures/ videos, and then won't work properly until I restart my Galaxy S4. When I manually end the app it launches again by itself and still doesn't function properly
Works fine, but once a day freezes my note 3 and need to reboot.
Ki
Funtastic
No messenger pls hust directly delivered the message in this application
Kind of lame that you have to download the messenger app to send messages
kak si
It shouldn't take this long to set up. Kinda Ridiculous.
Videos not working most of the,time
I was reading rates while downloading. You guys are right thiz app stinks
It is that we all need this app to access Fb, because, let's face it: the mobile website underperforms even more than the app. Just updated the app on Xperia Z1 Compact and now when I want to type (post, comment, caption, everything) the keyboard is not activated. And yes, for all other apps and the operating system the keyboard does fuction 100%
The app load but dose not allow me to do anything on my facebook...
It could be better
Ok
I want to give this app a 0 as soo as I open and click on a video it shut down
I love this
I love facebook
Starting to hate it. Keeps freezing!!
Idont  want  umar  hussen delet
And tho u need the 2nd app for messages I get the notification fornthe message but cannot read it!! Un installed
Help me to talk with friends .and it's free i can talk to my friens by voise i realy love it .it just amazing
Everytime I touch the desired feeling or even the desired travell location like "Travelling to blah". It goes back to the menu section where I will select "feeling,eating,travelling".
I changed my password 4 times and finally I found out that it just says that my password is wrong even if it is rite poo poo
I dont know my confermation code so I cant get on. I tried everything but nothing. It deserves zero stars untill u change it. My games, I trie to sign into facebook but the stupid confermation code. So for now im deleten it.
This is the best app I love it
Besho samer
Awesome
This app gives the best platform to use fb on ur phone..:)
I've update the same update like 5 times it doesn't work
Unable to "log out!"
Good app
I am on Facebook on my Samsung Galaxy tab 3 and i click on something, like a person's name, it just closes out. I have had different problems with it and now this? ??!!!? I am getting fed up with it.
Many links on fb posts broken since last update, unable to open them on Firefox or Chrome. Please fix it.
Best thing Eva
Stupid head App. (Dont want to know what I was  really saying) please for the love of fry bread fix it.
Enjoyable. And fun!!!
It was a good app at one point, but now...it continues to freeze and force close or crash at every given point in time, you really need to fix this app before you lose valued customers.
Have got it installed on Samsung tab 3 and it keeps shutting off and not letting posts go through. Actually rather annoying.
Life wouldn't be the same without it!!
great
it is big and heavy make take a lot of ram, make it lighter. Take an example from VK app it's awesome!!! Light, works well!!!
Not able to custom audience, new update is crap, recent history isnt showing every one, crap update

I cannot swipe full screen photos left right with the latest version.
I'm a hater sooo I don't like it all it is, is drama
Takes for ages for me to log in now when before it would only take seconds now its like 5minutes if that..sometime i log in and the pages dissappears...please fix..so annoying!!
More and more updates for apps but phones are becoming obsolete faster and faster! Can't even get this new update to open Facebook to the log in screen!! Stupid!
Since every update decides to break the app I decided to stay with a version that works and never update. It amazes me how they buy out other companies and can't do this right.
After my last update the app have been crashing every time I open. Kindly look into that issue asap...
Nice app
Put the messager back where it was please
X
Chat list is gone with up date super lame!! Forces shut fb stopped keeps happening un instaled n re installed to try n fix thete things still no chat ho I suppose to be docial if vant se whos available n wont stay up n force closes or just sucky sucky go off!!
For some reason I can't open the app. I uninstalled all the updates and it lets me use the basic app with no updates but that's it. I can't use the most recent one. Facebook, please fix. This is very upsetting.
Please fix it.
Installing for the third time in two days.Worked fine then updated and now I can't log out.I keeps going back to news feed. I like facebook but every updated gets worse please fix the issue.
None

I opened my spotify premium this morning to find that all my songs had dissapeared and UN downloaded. It then started glitching, freezing, and crashing. I attempted to open Facebook and it was doing the same.. My Facebook and spotify are connected and now thanks to Facebook. All my premium downloaded songs have dissapeared.... DISGRACEFUL
Awe
Verygood
I never feel alone with this app
But i have a problem using this app when I start it it suddenly stops working and aromatically exists I became sick of it so fix it

For a dinosaur, my experience has been quite positive.  I may have made the claim above, but three weeks on I find linking to Facebook on my phone too slow. Then fb's response to links are frustratingly slow, if it reach conclusion at all.
Prince
Don't like how slow it is.
Bullshit
I can chat to all my mates easily no matter where i am and it is even better with messanger
Deletes my photo captions
Nice

Too SLow :(
Crasher hele tiden efter opdatering... Kan heller ikke lade video uden wifi
Keeps me from being bord
Sloooooooooow
It makes me so frustrated how easily it is to slide over into friend requests or notifications. I would much prefer a menu option instead of using left or right to slide between pages.

New update sucks.
Education
Always crashes after a few seconds ever since the latest upgrade to Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Can't be used.  It's also very annoying to have a separate app for messging now.
Very poor was working really well on my samsung tablet for 6 mo ths since updating saturday it signs in click on  friend and it goes blank had tablet checked and is fault with your app.I have reloaded app 6 times on different days.Please fix this problem
Open
The video quality is not good anymore, regardless of the phone I'm using. Was there an update on this possibly??  My videos look so blurry, but seem to appear more defined on Instagram. Bleh.
Is cool
Works good
Great
Very useful and all that kind of stuff but every now and then the app crushes on random cases.
nice
Nice
I can't log in
Make the messenger app optional. I don't like giving it access to my private things.
I really like it. Easy to use and understand
All
It's okay. But its very slow.
awesome
Since last update i can't do anything, the app just closes. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, same result. Time to permanently uninstall an app that does not work. Big thumbs down.
Taquane
So good app.  Works fine on OnePlus

Won't stop crashing every 5 effin minits!!!!! I can't even be on for 5 mins and "Facebook is not responding" pops up! This is annoying!!!! Makes me not wanna use Facebook anymore!!!!
Keeps lagging, screen going black, and forcing close. This is one of the reasons I always end up just using the website.
Nice to share all the things
Its working ok now but, some sharing issues to a friends page they dont exsist but are in my friends list. Why Mr. Developer is that? Hummm?!
Its terrible can't even download it now

Big apps waste of mobile data
I mean this app deserve no stars because everytime i load the app it shuts off or closes down by itself. It can't because of the new kit kat upgrade, i don't know. Please fix.
Need to fix it
Why it takes much spaces in my device? I think the updates should be at least once for month
Love it
It freezez and just say "just a moment please". Then it restarts.
my facebook software is very slow plz update facebook software
2 gud
I love fb and i enjoy..
Thanks
Everytime i do anything like comment on a picture or try to go to a friends page it closes the app on me please fix!
I can not log in
eats a lot of ram even you not used it.scrolling become lags because of slow loading of images. not good for entry mobile.
I think this is like a man with big desire & passion but lack of energy. Big file capacity but tiny performance. Can you reduce the file capacity & increase the loading speed?
Now it's as fast as I want
Ok
Help me understand
I love Facebook but its to slow.
I am happy
It's amazing
F##king Hindi as default ? I tried to login for an app using Facebook account and its coming in Hindi wth ? India does not belong to Hindi people only !

Love it
I love it i can speak with all my friends.
My facebook will close off ever so often after the update was installed. Seems like there is a bug with the new update
Hw do I change my Facebook username
Crashes repeatedly after only a few seconds on an LG G3.
The new Internet browser that opens up when I click on links is soo slow. Can I disable it and use the browser that I like?
fast
Just tried it
The app keeps crashing since the last 2 updates. Not a happy camper.
It's wonderful
The app is lousy, it takes ten minutes to set up. Would download any other app if given a way out of this
I like face
FB opens, then closes.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  Noticed first only when going to my home page; now it just happens    randomly while looking through news feed.
App is very slow to load even over 4g and always says connection lost. Crashes more after update than did before, rarely loads photos.
App is quite big .it is not worling fast as the early version
I love it......
I really miss fb..guys can u fix this problem since i updated it  does not load..all the time it closes
Either roll back to the previous version or fix this version. It is loading slow crashing and/or not loading at all!!
Best app

I dont know whats wrong with your apps.its always updated on time and since I've installed messagers it always hang,everytime i have message in comment or personal message it hang also.i have so much space to my sd  card so i think its not about the memory card i used..can u fixed it if there is any problem..thats the only way i can contact my brother and sister in Davao Philippines
Its totally waste ...it consumes lot of internal storage and internet balance too and its too slow!
My Nexus 5 was giving all sorts of error messages, then when I tried to submit the report would tell me there's no room left despite having 4gb. The phone would also freeze. I factory reset & had no problems for two weeks, until I decides to re-download the Facebook app.  As soon as I logged into Facebook my phone started freezing, running slow, & throwing up all sorts of errors. I logged out of Facebook straight away & it's working fine again. Suffice to say I won't be logging into Facebook much now.

App closes on it's own on the new S5. Needs to have the option to REPLY to people's comments in comments and have comments appear under comments. And wish I can lock the news feed to current without switching.

Okay
News feed layout is terrible. When trying to see an entire post at once, it like playing the worst game of whack a mole ever with the bottom widget bar.  Top widget area is way too big.  C'mon, folks, it's almost 2015.  This sort of layout stuff is well known.
dhrampur

When I open up the app I would like to see the most recent posts from my friends. Instead I'm being shown posts from 2,3 even 5 days ago. And to make it worse the most recent update pushed the most recent tab further down the list on the menu.
Very good
Chat not working
This is really really Great website.
Woow
Very nice
Very slow after last update
very nice
Freezes up a lot.  It's annoying.

Dont like the news feed would rather have recent. When i delete pics they are still seen until i uninstall then reinstall. My timeline will only load so much as im scrolling then quits and i need access to things i have saved on my page.
Facebook doesn't care about cyberbulling
So slowley and soo big
Fix everything......
Happy
Slow most of the time. Find it cumbersome to deal with. Most of the time it opens to pages thay are a day or two old. It never shows me what I upload untol a day or so later.
Crashes when you do anything but look at the news feed, I am sure Facebook are looking at this, but HOW LONG TILL THE FIX?
Good
Every time I try to scroll down my newsfeed it freezes this is ridiculous! You try make us get an extra app when you can't even work the first one.
nice!
You know guys you all are complaining in  facebook but it is good . in movie called setan Facebook is horror Facebook a girl get cheated and she commit suicide after that she went to kill people that those who cheated her . those who cheat people maybe they will commit suicide and come and kill you.lol

Dear FB team I want to mention a problem which I am facing and I am sure this is occurring with others as well. The problem is when you upload your profile photo, why it always says move and scale, it should upload photo straight away or there must be some way to skip this step. Please consider this problem and allow us to upload full photos.......

IT'S SO SLOW! WHEN I OPEN IT, IT JUST SIMPLY CLOSES AGAIN!!! PLSSS..... FIX THIS!!
Keep having error loading videos..
Gud app
Bekaar
App don't load when you go to use it. Phone just goes to a crawl in speed and your left with just staring at a white screen. App also eats battery and space like no tomorrow. Up until the last few days ago this app was fine. Now it has gone to the dogs. I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 1. Please sort it asap and I will up my rating again.
Wher is log out without deleting the app? With the last update the phone becomes so unresponsive... not only the app. I have to uninstall it just to normally use my phone. As soon as I remove it from "recent applications" or uninstall it, my phone works normally. Totally useless.
I wish there was a back button to exit photos and videos. The buttons on my phone don't work so as soon as I open a photo I have to then restart my phone to get back to my feed.
Sucks!
I love...Facebook!
I've removed this app several times and put it back on and it keeps on crashing why ?
Good
Awesome app!!!
The best
It's very nice software
Very very slow
I only see gray. Then a crash
Very best app in all world but it has some informal idies and pages. .
So late to load pics n movies should give negative stars
Muahhhh
Altho no alt for keeping in touch with online social community. No real competition out there means have to use this crap app. Can I award no stars???
its app is .very slow so change that.
It's a lot better than what it was but now I can't read messages in my other folder from my phone (galaxy s4) witch is a pain as I dnt use a computer much any more as I can normally do everything on my phone
Why is that everytime I open this app it forces to stop? And you'll wait for how many minutes just to load and open it! This app is just a WASTE OF TIME! If you have an option of ZERO I will rate this stupid app as ZERO! Please fix this!
Good one
Doesn't working

Easy
It always STOP
Its sometimes difficult to open page
Spaced!
Awesome
Every time I open the app it shuts down right away. Haven't been able to use it for a couple of days. Sucks, wouldn't happen with apple.

Good apps
It takes a million years to set up then it closes off
After updating this app today, when I open facebook it always says "Setting up Facebook" then "Just a moment" then suddenly it closes. After trying many times, still the same. This is my first time encountered this problem.  I think it has bug. Please fix. Looking forward for a feedback. Thank you
Please make fb app more minimalist and small size .this app take about 100^up MB soo boring...

Insane. It doesnt log u out whenever u want to logout but logs u out randomly if u dont want to! It always slow and stuck on error loading. I still have the same, reliable wifi conn. Do u screw up the dual core users? All apps seems to be crappy nowadays.

Uthpalaperera

So slow to load pics. WTH.
Crashing, unresponsive, grey screen.
Everytime I open Facebook, it either shows a pop up box showing not corresponding or setting up facebook. As in ALWAYS. Like I open it now, close, and open again and that's what it shows. -.-
This is good app.

Good
I like this app.
The latest update is now fast! :) even the available ram is only 80mb but its still fast! Amazing haha. but i can give you 5 stars if the app will only have 10-30 Mb of memory. It cosumes a lot of memory and i dont know why.
Superb
COOL
I hate it. I'd rather eat glass than look at  these peoples' selfies and pretend to remember each other fondly. Eff all of ya... especially The Hooker that gave my man the herpes simplex II.

App still auto plays videos on the news feed freezing the entire thing, makes me want to delete Facebook altogether

hays
Dis is d coolest app ever #addictd
Arcelle maestre
Very nice
goooooob
I uninstall the app. This app is the only one that I have on my phone and it's already full storage. Facebook is updating for high-end phone and it's really unfair for low-end phone users. Is there any options for low-end phone??

I hate the moment when you're messaging your friend then it closes. How rude? -_-
I love this app.
Facebook ... is the best !
It is not getting downloaded even for the second time
Nice

Cristielyn alicaway

Definitely not 23mb, try over 100mb, I cleaned data from 190mb, and it's still 123mb!! Uses so much CPU it makes phone heat up in minutes. Better off using Facebook through your browser!
Soooooooo good
Gets slow while login nd log out
Crash after crahs. Waist of mg
AWESOME
Great ap
Good
App closes automatically. Makes you hate Facebook. And only post when it wants to. Not worth the download
Im with my friends always
I like it
What happened ? -..- a few days ago it works so fine but now I can't open it because of the latest update -..-
best ever
I don't want to see a bunch of post from yesterday. I want to see the most recent post. I feel like I've missed alot.Bring that option back. No idea why you guys took it off.
Good app
Its ok
to slow.....
from the bigning m just asking how i can save pics ??
Facebook has the permission to go through our personal information and use it as a way to update their app. They also can see what we see via front/back camera. This is crazy. This has gone to far with privacy.
It is  very slow and always asks to download a facebook messenger
Aynalem  belay
Very very very very good
nay yan
I don't know what's wrong with this update this app is not responding.  I can't get it opened.  I have to go into messenger then view profile then after 50-60 secs it gets opened. Plz fix this.  It's too annoying.
POOOOOOOOOOOOO
Can ypu reduce the memory size of this aplication after instaled & updated...

Every time I get on and start scrolling threw my feed, it freezes and takes forever to load. A lot of times it won't let me watch the videos and when it Does it takes forever and I know it's not My phone because it's doing it to everyone that I know, I'm starting to get extremely aggravated and try other social media apps if it doesn't get fixed here pretty freaking soon
It's worthfully
Not at all satisfied with the app because by using it battery drains more faster than any other app it uses 10 to 20 % of batterey consumption in 15 mins so whats dis not at all expected also it occupies alot space around 90 mb pls Facebook try to get an update solved abouth this two concern problems thanks
Very Slow I hate this very much

Really like this apps but now, I can't logged out and change with others username....
mast h baap
So, in order to save me 1 second loading my browser Facebook have decided to use an in built browser that takes 10 times as long to load content or doesn't load it at all. Massive fail.
This app is just plain garbage. Time to uninstall it.
Latest update.... Not too good....Now it's very slow to load.
Robin byrd
will be waiting for more updates.
nice
V good ap I love i
Its to slow and so big app !!!! 42.24 mb ahhh!!! So bored app I never give any other app less than 3 star
Before I updated everything was fine. After the update the program crashes anytime I open
Faster
Hope some improvements...
It keeps crashing everytime I run the app.  Never happened before. So disappointed
It freezes all the time cause of eating big amount of ram. Can't reply fast. Do you have a partnership w/ a mobile companies for us to upgrade phone as much as this app upgrades? Smh!
it is very fast and very easy
Very slow app and heats up tablet! Please fix.
Its disconnecting from the Internet. Pictures not loading. Constantly crashing...
I like it

Good app
Sangat menghibur, , dat ramai kenalan n boleh jumpa kawan lama ,,, berbagai cerita & berbagai pengalam
Its so much space.  Its annoying having my phone tell me I need to free up space and its always the  facebook app
You guys should listen to what other people think about your crappy updates, not only did my phone loose a lot of memory from that fb messanger, but it also got slower because of the new update
Connecting much people
Far too buggy to use.
V slow... big no no...!
nice one
I just love it
Great!

Excellent
I love it so much
Too  big and Very slow after update this apps!
Brutally slow loading....like dialup internet....seriously!  A year ago it was just fine, now really sad. Now in October 2014 why do i get day old updates??? Brutal
Crap
Wow.cool
Needs to have birthday notifications and settings to block certain people from status updates within the app and a setting to view the most recent status  updates. .since it's always running and uses so much battery it should be able to have all functions! I'm using a nexus 5 too it needs to be perfect for all the money spent and if I'm going to continue using Facebook . also messenger should have a setting where people can't see that you have read their messages. Kinda deserves zero stars until I see this
Good
Big Raw
Ok
Monju
I more liked the old version because this app need messenger and it make my app lag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not very good keeps freezing like No 
Perfect !
I love this app
Awsm App
Laggy
Why is it such a big app.   :(
Very good
Consume so such of my phone memory and it is verytslow. And pls why do we need to install messenger when we only used it seldomly.
The required new messenger app is way too invasive. Fb should have the option to use the old "all in one app" FB messaging system. Instead i gotta consent to them being able to listen in on my calls, view my texts, photo albums, browsing history etc? It stinks of potential threats of hacking, identity theft, government snooping and who knows what else. BOOLSHIIIIITTTTT!
It kept closing out all the time
I like it
It is good and faster.
Facebook is the best apm
Good
Needs to upload videos faster, and provide links to other sites. Mobile app way to large and takes way too much space...I think its time to switch to YouTube Social!!!

For some reason this has taken over my phone that had to delete everything and still won't work
,v GB vj mm.
How do you developers suck at your jobs to the point that you develop an application that takes up such ridiculous amounts of space. I mean you obviously are the lowest rung of development teams but good lord. If you would pull your heads out of your forth points of contact. You might learn to do your jobs and actually build a program that is not the size of most HD gaming applications. I won't hold my breath either way.
Falto apps
Cool
Eehhhh

Wow nice good evar
Lve it
I hate this update.....always force stoping why u cant fix the fuckin app?? Fix it....
I have no problems with Facebook mobile. Great for on the go.
Enjoy your social experiments among the masses. Your app is still not defaulting to recent stories. I'm ready for Ello or something equivalent to it.
Not downloading in Xperia E1
Its good 4 chat
Nice
App is way to large, cannot move to SD card, its always slow, it closes out randomly, you forced us to use messenger to send messages  and you never listen to your users. You are bad Facebook. Just absutely horrible.

Social media
Science has been developed a lot... But I can't edit my profile, my education work and other personal settings on Facebook on my cell phone, its not fair and squire at all. ...
Cool
But they must give Facebook messenger inside it only
Great
This is wonderful application
Don't like that people can steal copy my pic's since private chaged.. that is why I used that setting.  Bullies take things of my profile post places and say nasty things. Where is your security gone out to lunch?
Searching
Its amazing
Not sing in or long in why
as they say its true--it suck!!!
Nice
Grt app
I want will give u four if you solve the problem given below I recieve comment or any notification even after i replied them on desktop! I dont need to recieve it ,once i starred it on desktop. Thank you     solved...
Simply clear
It freezes up my phone every time I get on the app
,,not so easy to use
I just can't get this app to install on my phone! It always says there is insufficient memory, even when the only things on my phone are the factory installed apps. I use Facebook frequently, but I just can't use it on my phone. Granted, I have a Huawei Glory, but still...there needs to be a lite version of this app for the lesser of the powerful smart phones. I'm not going to be one of those people who gives just 1 star because of one little problem. I've seen good things this app can do on other phones.
Huh! Can't be called an app. Dissatisfied.
Very good .fantastic
Its amazing it makes it easy I don't have to be on Facebook to get my messages
High quality perpormance
So slowwwwww u shld not update it...it got worst
Minal mhatre
I've seen a lot of complaints with the user.. if this app doesnt work well with you then just delete it.. never complain with something you get for free.. use your browser instead.
I hate to have to say it this for my phone is by far thee worst facebook update ever so many functions do not work right. Please you know what they are so fix them!
Facebook

Works flawlessly!
Everyone can see your private stuff. Even if you aren't friends with them.
Need fast
App has to configure itself everytime I want to open it... Then it freeze and not responding!!!
Didn't work well, not user friendly
Easy to use
fix this really needs improvement
Not compatible with 4.4 x86???
A  lot of time  to download
Keeps saying error loading news feed
Facebook
good
I can not compare it to any poor apps so far very bad
Crash crash crash. Links to web pages and YouTube cause crashes. Suuuucks.
Facebook
I love face book so much.
Slow loading...
Every time I open the app it says one moment please. IF it lets me en in it only crashes a little bit later.
To slow this apps i cant log in instantly  always forcing close
I used to love fb but since I got my new galaxy note and had to install the latest version it been complete sh*t! Takes forever to post anything, news feeds won't update, and it crashes all the time. Seriously fb? Y'all are sitting back making millions and millions of dollars on this app yet you can't seem to get it right? Are your app engineers drunk or something? I read through and nearly everyone is having these problems yet nothing has been done about it! Tired of wasting my time trying to figure it out
2568
It needs an option to view recent stories on my news feed. Not top stories.. All I see is post from days ago.
Can't even log on as it keeps booting me off and when I do manage to log in it boots me off saying it is not responding!! Sort it out!!!! Doesn't even deserve one star!!!
Aman man like this app
All I'll say is screw how you made them combine not interested

My net is 3g but this app is slow
Good app

itz easy to use..thanks fb
Fast
Uninstalled
Hummm....I like this app so much we together fronds talking with old frnds also
For one there's no reason for Facebook to need access to the things I do on my phone! For two we should not have to download two different Facebook apps just to communicate with our friends, family and the media!!!!!! Facebook is just making it easier for criminals to access our personal information!!!!!
Admin
very slow
Xlent
The older version was better...
Not an app
Hello
Bad no good
Very smart app
I can't open facebook since last update.
This app is horrible i cant believe that after all this time and so many people complaining nothing has been done yet makes u not want to download any apps because of the thought it might not work, fix it already and i honestly dont think u check your reviews. ( when on u get bumped off the moment u touch something on the page or on news feed fix if not no one is gonna want this app!)
Very slow
Living it
simply superb
Doesnt let me make photo comments. Was fine till latest update

Download
So nice :)
just done update dated 2 oct 2014 and still keeps closing down. Obviously still not compatible with android 4.4.2 on my tablet even though it says it is. Poor rating given.
Not so good. -_-
Intervation,exactly amazing recipient pleasing everyone.
It takes up to much space/storage on my phone
Very very good.
Amazing
Hallo friends
Fb
This has got to be the worst version of facebook! It worked just fine before and then all of a sudden the new update came in and now it takes wayyy to much fricken space so i cant even download the fb app. This is not right, get it together and make it to where there isnt so much data just to download this app. I have to use facebook on the regular browser on my phone now! Fix this problem! 0 stars. It was fine the way it used to be.stop updating all the time.
I will be on the app for 10 seconds and as soon as i click om something the app closes. Very annoying

Keeps shutting off
Soo good
Facebook app rocks

Prarthana
Used to be amazing. No 168 mb after downloading and setting up is insane. Slowly moving my personal businesses off Facebook. Building more personal relationships instead of ad based application. I can use web browser on mobile device. Works just like desktop version without invasion of privacy.
Always works good for me
Nice way to chat
I love facebook
I always shuts down on me and won't ever let me update my statuses or anything!!!! I am so not impressed.
Wi-Fi sucks
Asp
Facebook
Better now about time
Crashes quite often. I am not fond of messenger being shoved down my throat.
Rays
Why
Agfter ages of iphone user I find my new hslaxu S5 apps beter faster
Why the connection was very slow. I srarted to install it last night!
Its taking forever to lode
Nice
Good
Stupid
Achi app hai me toh khush ho aur aap
This app is useless. It makes me never want to use Facebook. I spend so much time waiting for things to load and don't seem to have the same functionality as other users. Its a complete time-suck. Maybe its just an android thing.
Used to be fine but now it won't even load the feed. Nothing in my live feed will update, can't send messages or post anything (it just hangs there till it fails). Wth? Please FIX IT.
Upset  with fave book logins...no help.
I know them much better
Whats on my mind
I absolutely hate that even if you turn off the refresh news feed it still does it every 30 to 45 minutes,  VERY ANNOYING.  Especially when you're right in the middle of reading something & it instantly just scrolls to the top no matter what you do, FIX THAT issue PLEASE.  The other annoying thing it does is ever since the last update whenever you get a notification of someone liking or commenting on something tied to you it pops up a bar at the top of the screen telling you about & stops your typing.
Cool
It's working!
How many freaking updates y'all need to do. Tired of every freaking day updates.
This is really cool but could be better.
I can't send relationship requests... Rating will change if that's fixed :s
Lots of issues still going on. Half the time, the pictures won't even load. Logging on and off take forever! Obviously whoever is in charge of this problem seems to be paying no attention to it. Great way to run a business!
Seriously with the new update my facebook app always crashes, please do fix it.
Its quick and easy to use. I don't have to open up chrome then go to Facebook. Now all I do is simply touch the app.
Bikram thapa
Not only does the videos eat up all my. Memory and data, now it won't even load for me to log in. And I've uninstalled everything. This app sucks!!!
Cool apps
That's what it is. Very good.
I can't watch videos. I still need to copy & paste the links to other browser, or copy the title of the video to youtube
Amazing....
961
Just seem to have alot of trouble watching videos on my sony xperia m
Not letting me upload photos on my page. Motorola droid maxx. Please fix!
since lastest update just keeps freezing & crashing, DISLIKE soo much!
It is good but slow
Plus its worse since they forced us to use messenger maybe twitter is the way to go these days.
Chat page for me
Every time I go to open app it crashes you guys are trash at makeing this app
I have to go through apps to get it to start. This is not faster. Tried everything to get my normal start :-(
It crashes like every 3 seconds!!!
This facebook allvar fevaret
Loved it
It is very gud
Fans
What the f! So large and so slow app! Please fix it
Its osm
II'm ready
It takes a LOT of storage and uses up the battery. When its 100% it goes down to 30%. Before i downloaded the app it wasntnlike this. Please make it  take less storage
Ethical
Fb get out the information you need  out  to your love ones & friends. Fb is positive to the people who are positive and negative to people who are negative inside them self..
When I was updated android the face book wasn't found in my phone
I am a curious girl and enjoy seeing What others post.
It is a gamble when you open it if it will freeze or work properly, when it does freeze . Have to power off the phone to reset it , sometimes have to do it multiple times
Every time I try and watch a video, I receive a error message.
It gets useless every now and then
I cant see full news feed posts
Wont even download in the first place
Too slow to download pics
Lol jk
This app I using long time,
Very easy
Like it very mush it helps me a lot !

Every few tries, there is an error loading news feed since last update. Just shows old posts.
Faster download needed
I love it was great 4 me
Acha vala update lao.
Shuts off constantly.  Cant do anything without it shutting off.  GET IT FIXED
Extreme battery drain after latest update (uses same percentage as screen!) still present in last 2 updates. Slow scrolling, a lot more demanding app. Terrible!!
This app cannot install on kitkat
Cool
V nice
Every time I scroll down the phone totally starts to freeze
Slow to load Newfeed and Profile. 
It is ok
A little bit ..though it comsumes more time in my battery but ..its okay .. sometimes annoying!
Difficulty to sign in !!!
Love this because i can see all my Grandchildren my children

Candy crush
5
Good..but pls..add more..hehe..more technical inproovments.
It's.very good
So cool
Sending a message takes too long. You can't create an album then directly put or upload pictures in it.  Slow news feed update or notification. Slow connection when using only mobile data, it only works with wifi connection. You can't turn your chat setting into offline. You can't reedit your comment.
Y ppl rather vanity more than to receiving christ....y the worl upside down at one nation wen u should be happy to have a god that loves u n me......
Tagal mag loading. Hays.
Cool
Crazy  fun
Why is the code

It is cool get it
New layout is awful. Facebook is lucky I need it it communicate with some people and groups or I would delete my acount.
It always works. I love it!!!
App not working right lots of problems here lately need fixing
emailbook
Would be better if I didn't have to constantly kill and re-open to get it to refresh.
Great social netwk
Every time I use this App it Crashes so offense that at times it becomes unusable Please Fix
Face  book
It won't even open anymore! All I get is. "Just a moment " for hours and nothing happens.  Also eats up my internal memory.  Uses almost 60 KB and the app doesn't even open! Do the developers even read these comments?!?!
Error
App is always freezes and now I can't even login. Worst app.
Its cool
Great
So slow
The Facebook man!
Jst try to reduce its size.
Tomascruz
Takes forever to open
I keep getting error -24
Nice
This app is the only way I fb anymore
Freezes as soon as I scroll through feed
I want facebook
Bad relashion
The best for ever
Between the new messenger requirement and the pictures not loading its almost pointless to have. Please fix facebook. Before you end up like Myspace.
Good
The newest update i can't even log-in(without a error message) then when i do get logged in, it will NOT log off! Very frustrating i have figure out ways around ALL the error messages!
This app sucks
This app is not syncing with my candy crush game.
SUCKS
Does of  app? I like. Ok
Awesome
Very slow
k.p.
Same complaint that everyone else has, I pay for a smart phone to have facebook and can't even use it! It always says it's loading, or it forces me out of the app completely,  I can't look at pictures, I can't update my status, not impressed at all. Wish this was an app that worked!
Good
Its cool
after update this app, i cant open this app
too slow for the news feed...
Read the permissions that this app is aloud to do without your knowledge. A small list : read, send and receive all of your texts, make calls, take pictures and videos, Reid anything that's your microphone can hear. Read the real list before downloading and it will shock you and possibly stop you from downloading!
Crashes every time I open it. Takes a lot of space
Pooh Bear
I'm not getting any of my notifications to my phone on y time I see them is when I open my app please fix
50% of the time I play a video, it takes very long to load or crashes fb, sending me a message saying Facebook is unresponsive... Please fix
Its too slow
This new update to facbook isn't good . I go to click on the facebook icon on my home page and it says setting up facebook and then kicks me off . So alot of time I can't get on facebook  NEEDS FIXING NOW
All it keeps doing is freezing!!! Fix this app!
Big ran eater the app eat 100mb -70 mb from my ram even when the app is closed and not running in the recent and the messenger app wich i hate it and i am forced to use it is also a ram eatter on low end phones with 1gb - 512 mb ram it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the app smoth fix it and i will give it a 5 stars
Since upgrade, it hasn't opened up for me to even use at all. Dissapointing.
The app is to big for what seems like no reason at all. Everytime its "fixed" its broke more.
Love it
It's great
After last few updates its working fast. Hope it will give the same options in android too.
Quite simply slow, ram demanding and takes up so much space! Why?! Please update!
This deserved zero star...
Whaha
Screw you guys! I'm sick and tired of seeing the top stories style news feed. I could care less what everybody else likes or sees. Just show me the most recent stuff. I don't want to scroll down to the bottom just to select most recent.
Im tired using fb on my pc then here
Since the update the app force closes, freezes, won't accept my comments, when I hit home screen to check something in middle of status update,.I go back and have to write it all again. Frustrating. App is way too big
Where are they at??!! Why isnt it set to default to that? I want to see what my friends post recentley not something days ago!!!!
It keeps crashing please fix!! Its so annoying
Please fix this keep closing
Perfect!
I love. it

As always awesome :'D keep up the good work !!!!!
would have given a five star but i cant read my messages,i dont know why i should have a different app just to read my messages.not cool
Freezing up still! Force closing constantly!!! Rumors are that your gonna charge, this app sucks so bad...you'll crash and burn! Fix the crap!
It's always crushing it loads very slow kindly fix this
Its ok
I like chatting with my friends that's why I bought this app
:)
@
-.- its so slow to download and it take alot of time to install
Well
This app is pretty good. There is only two problems. When you logout it kind of takes a long time. Also when I am scrolling down my news feed, the app freezes for about a minute, then I cant even scroll down I would have scroll up and refresh and then it would work. Overall it is a pretty good app just a few bugs.
App upload is slow
When I open my fb, It crushed down after 2min. PLEASE FIX IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
Uninstalled until you fix it
I like the Facebook app and platform.
:-)
Samsung upgrade to kitkat has caused Facebook to be so unstable that I've given up on it. How many Galaxy S3 Tabs out there are similarly affected.
It helps me to
Maybe if you've got a high-end phone. Not everyone does. Between the bloat of the basic app, constant crashing, AND requiring the extra messenger app, you're making decisions about space on my phone easier & easier. }:( With every release I've hoped for less hogging of resources, never mind "greater speed." I just spent over 10 minutes waiting for the app to start & finally just gave up. And no, that was *not* from an uninstalled state.
Azhar
Crashed, looked at status n crashed. Luked at fotos n crashed. Hopeless n very annoying
Only thing I can do is uninstall the updates. Every couple of hours my phone is dying and saying I'm low in memory. This is ridiculous.
I can no longer report inappropriate photographs and statuses. Also, certain aspects of this app are slow such as image loading.
This Fucken App Made me uninstall My Old 1 and Made Me install The New One Which takes to fucken long!!!!!!!
Its a bit slow
it sucks!!!
Facebook app is not using correct Android APIs to synchronize contacts and events.
Not bad
Wasting of Time :@
Verry good
This is going to be the 3rd time that I am reinstalling this App And this is the last if ever! I'm tired with all of the hanged ups etc.
Its not bad bt.  For chating purpose its too good.. coz...i used since last 2 years....bettr than messenger.     .....    n for data its too bad  ...it hangs a cell phone some time...
Yes
Why
Since new update no videos will play.
Especially when I'm in the events section. And i cant add an image when I create an event which is silly
Facebook continuously closes and I cannot use on the new tablet I purchased so I could see the app better without hauling around a laptop. Please add an option for a zero/NO Star rating because I have zero Facebook interaction. Or would I say #NObook?
not satisfied plz fixed it fast
Best application
I can see all my family. And ny husbends family. To from. Mxico. And his. Kids to we love
oh it problems me
This has got to be the worst update ever! Unstable and unpredictable. Sometimes notifications load and sometimes they don't. Come on Facebook you have been doing this for too long to be making such a crappy app. Time to check out Google+

Keeps collapsing and trying to set up again...please fix this...I can't  get it to work
*** STILL SUCKS *** News feed STILL sucks.  I don't want to see posts from yesterday or older mixed in with recent posts.  Allow MOST RECENT to be a default.  So annoying.
I like this
If you turn on notifications on someones status update, when you click "turn off notifications" it doesn't work, and I'm fed up of receiving constant notifications when someone comments.
Why we'll install 2 apps for single purpose... Dont facebook developer have this common sense...
Awsome
Saber
Incompatible Update...on my sony e1 plz plz fix...i updated my android from 4.1 to 4.3...nw it doesn't wna install
Wish never installed this update... Have tried to get previous version of Facebook back without any luck
This app is not good .the load of newfeed always not work soooooo baaaad
plz update because from facebook i can't download any video
Wth is wrong with this Facebook app?? And you taking to long too load
exe
Because I am not able to chat with my friend and if I want to chat than other app is required for this
Facebook works good. Have no issue with new update like others.
Thank you
Like it
Thanks
Did they remove the "Recent Activity" section for friends pages, or "Recently Added Friends" ??  Can't find that info anywhere anymore, or even Pokes... Why!? Very disappointing... :-/
When I used to login, it takes lot of time and when that login process is going and going on if I press back button it get started... isn't it funny? ??
Constantly locks up on my note 3.  Ridiculous
Its a nice app ... but still it lags a bit
Best App
Shwartz
Facebook
Can't delete photos.
the worst thing is u cant even chat. messenger needs to be downloaded
I like it.
everytime i've to reinstall it
This is great I love it :)
Good website
Its fun asf
I can only be on it for one minute before the app force closes on its own. Fix it already jeez.
It good
Very bad.. new update...
Greatest social media app for older people
When I click message then my device is hanh
I have no idea what happened or what changed, but the Facebook app on my galaxy tab force closes CONSTANTLY and has done so for the past few days. I open the app, scroll or click a few times  and it closes. Open again, rinse repeat. I will try uninstalling and reinstall, but I refuse to install the app on my phone again, so if facebook doesn't resolve this issue then i will just be using it a lot less since accessing it through the mobile browser is slow and annoying. REVISED: installed the update just now. Still force closing, but is closing even faster now. I dont even get a chance to scroll or click anything before it closes. I guess this shat can be considered an undocumented feature. Well done. -_-  10/5/2014 Installed latest update.  STILL force closing.
Every time I get on Facebook on my phone, it logs me out and crashes. The new update is what I think is doing it. PLEASE FIX.  P.s. I'm on a Samsung Illusion.
Love
Facebook app stopped working after the last update. Not even starting up . no star at all.
Good
Just log on using the browser so much less trouble
It says unknown error.. 110
Love this think lol
This app keeps freezing up and everytime I hit comments in force closes and stops
Its ok  but for youth who need to find themselves
Fun
Its ok
My Jaan
Very nise
Excellents
Jindgi esi ka nam he
I love it
Like so many others I get blue screen logo then crash. How can the most used app around not have been debugged before release. Looking at recent reviews, I'd say no one is too big to become obsolete, even FB.
Takes forevvvvveeeerrr to download this app its ridiculous...
Awesome
Flop show
It freezes and cant open right away
Sucks it will not open!!!!!!
Muhaaaaaaaaaa
I hate that you have to down load the messanger app just message on fb now. This app keeps forcing closed.
It was good for a while, but now it won't load any pictures in my news feed. And when i go to someone's profile their profile pic and cover photo won't load sometimes.
Everyone says that it deserves 0 stars and they deserve to rate it that and the can't well don't rate
nice one very nice apps
When I try to watch a videos that friends post, it freezes up. Also sometimes I'll be looking @ my news feed, & it will back me completely out of fb. Makes no sense to me.
This last update blows! It is constantly freezing up. I give it two thumbs down, fix it Facebook techs! Now!
What you're doing is not working.. After I press the thing I'm doing it goes back to the first page. Love the app please fix this..
After the update, Facebook app closes when attempting to visit friends timeline or leave a comment. Please fix.
Cool
Its terrible don't waste your time its slow to
Cool
Constantly freezes while browsing my feed.
Needs the ability to share videos and other posts on timeline, to other social media's. Such as Twitter or even instagram? Would be really awesome if you could share videos you see on Facebook, on to instagram.
Absolute rubbish. Since last upgrade been unable to use via the app. ..have to use via the Internet.  Decided to try again. ..downloading now and has been stuck on 93% for 20 minutes. ... not good.
EVER SINCE THE UPDATE IT SOMETIMES GLITCH OUT WITH THIS GRAY SCREEN BS WTF
Mast
Force close always..plz make it stable nd fast
Good aap I'm loving it

Nice app but it consumes too much time in opening.
Good
Easy to use. It's by far one of the best apps
You dont need access to everything on my phone nor do you need to track my location.
Nice
Hate facebook
Love the app!!!
this app is really bad news. I have to uninstall and redo it all again and again. please sort it out.
Every new update is shittier than the last one.

Shame I can't give zero stars. Installed ok on my phone but it won't open so I don't have access to my fb
Love it
This is the best
The app makes my whole device slow down. Once I uninstalled it everything ran faster. If you can fix these bugs, I will reinstall the app. In the mean time, I will not have this app on my device.
Thanks
I love this app
Since update, it opens and then shut straight away. Waste of time.
I love my famiy

Chole mortz
I love the Facebook and Messenger app. I have been using the Facebook app for such a long time. I have never had any issues with it whatsoever. I have read the comments from several people and all I read is their cries about how the app does not work for them. Have you ever heard of Facebook App for dummies? Cell phone for dummies? It sure sounds like you need one of these books. If that's not the problem then obviously you have no business having a cell phone. Stop your crying.
Its awesome
I use 1st then rate it
,  
We should not need the Facebook messenger
Fun
It doesn't opens properly  and needed much data to operate it it is like b....
Not bad

Make it lighter...why does it need 50-60mb ram? Before the update took about 17mb...it was a lot then...now is just crap. Most app never go over 10mb...and guess what? Some of them are a lot more complex than facebook app...
It's OK
Needs fixing. But really like it though

Very good
Fab :)
Facebook's
I cannot open this app . This app is sucks!!!!
The new update does not allow you to view your profile page and boots you out randomly. Instead of the update facilitating me in using facebook, now it is creating problems. Therefore,  there should be a new update to fix all the errors instesd if creating them.
Facebook :p
Love is life
Terrible, slow!!!!!!
I love it! :) But... it keeps force closing!
I am mad of this app.very poor
I love facebook

(Rating: ZERO STARS) Bring back the built in messenger. Forcing me to install the separate messenger app is a big violation of my right to choose! A BIG BULLY, COMMUNIST-LIKE ATTITUTE!
Nice
I don't have a friken account of this app
Even though opted out to homescreen the video/image becomws a wallpaper and would only disappear once process is killed. Also app has becomw a memory hogger. Fix that and i should rate u good.
Great
Govind
Every time I try and share or post a status the app closes down. Really annoying. Get it sorted
Face book is love
Awsome
There's alot of bugs that need to be fixed
suck..application ;(
Working properly for me, nice, but otomatic open, eats my ram, ,harrd to force close
Gud 2 share
Thanks for all
It is a gd social ntwrkng site
Good one
F****ing app.....really...wenever I try to post ...it will be displaying facebook isn't responding. ... ..
Too much lag :/ way to slow I've had to reformat my phone 6 times just to use it its bullshit
Good
It freezes my phone sometimes
I can't even get on it just says one moment please I try to get on after work everyday but it doesn't work you're gonna lose a lot of facebookers
It's osm relly bt miss use to much
This app is horrible for my tablet, shuts down. Please fix
How to photo's save in messengers
This new update sucks!! I'm uninstalling FB until you can get your crap together. It won't load anymore. I just get a gray screen or a loading page that says "One moment please" and then it crashes.
Doesn't start..
Beside the null privacy, i want most recent as my default...
Please test videos played through the app on the Xperia Z1. Recently started using this phone and I'm experiencing problems playing the videos. Either half the video will play, then the rest freezes or it won't play at all. Connected through wi-fi and no issue playing videos on sites or YouTube. Thanks
Downloaded and installed updates but it constantly crashes on my Galaxy tab 3...NOT happy!
Things need to get better.  Every time i open the app on my tablet, it closes.  Really need to get a fix for this problem
Screws up my system if used.
Good
When i scroll down my news feeds the videos load and freeze my phone... takes hella long to stop to... and theres alot of videos so its just nonstop freezing
awesome
I hate the fact that in order to get your messages you need a separate app. This is ridiculous.
Best Is the best.. I Like..
Device
super bad update
Denying certain intrusive permissions to the app causes Facebook to freeze repeatedly. For example, denying the camera/microphone permissions causes NO problems, yet denying GPS permissions even if my location is off DOES crash the app. (Phone permissions also somehow undeniable as well) I'm not rooted, which might be why. Nexus 7 running 4.4.4
Stay on FB way too much bc its that good thanks MarkZ.
All can't get face book till next day hoses to do what ever it wonts  the whole phone stinks I can go on and on  refund please
Mayur
I lov it
KK
Cayokk memang terhebat
Why does facebook need all these permissions for my microphone, wifi, camera, gps, access to everything?  Seams really suspicious that it requires all of that without my permission.
Awesome
Its fun
When I try and play videos they freeze right in the middle of it and don't load
Your stupid app doesn't even let me post.  I've tried it for 3 days and keeps kicking me out Might be the phone? ? Who knows but its making me fuckin mad.
Just updated..  n now its not working at all .. Won't even load up arghh

it sucks
Awesome
Good
Shows the loading symbol and crashes
Please fix everytime i open it i get about 4 or 5 stories down and it crashes and shuts down the  i have to restart it again and it keeps doing it please fix it.  My friends are from another state and this is how we keep intouch.
The last version before this is better :(
Nice app
This updated Facebook is crap it sucks. it takes forever to do anything and of late it keep saying 'wait a moment'yet still even after 30 mins I'm still waiting...
This app needs more work on it. Sometimes it says i need to force close and has a lot of bugs DONT DOWNLOAD,you will unninstall it, JUST A WASTE OF TIME!!!!! :l
Please do something .
Facebook app keeps crashing
How can i even like it if I cant even run it. It takes up too much space.
Awesome
Worked before, but after the latest update, it just closes as soon as it opens on my phone.  Total wipe of the phone and still the same.  Absolute bo*locks.
App keeps kicking me out!
Nice
Facebook is awesome
Ready like staying in touch with friends and Family
Not sure when it started but, it keeps crashing..... Samsung Tab 3 user..
Keeps freezing I have to Uninstall the app like twice a day then reinstall it to get it to work
The app will shutdown  so often that I barely use it. Will stick to browser and uninstal it
Does not show very many of friends' posts, an ad or spam post every 4 posts, blacks out when I try to tag people in photos.
Killjggbn. H.
When this is open it says just a moment then redirects me to my home page..  It soo stupid it deserves 0 stars

new facebook for android is not good ... older facebook is nice ... so  update it
I used this app for almost a year now. But since last week, I cant open the app no more. So what happen???
Its amazing app
Great
Loved it to keep up with the people of Facebook
Nice
The update was really suprising! I love the new features like the new way the photos are presented through mobile! Keep up the good work facebook!
I love my facebook
Every time I open it, fb closes. FIX PLEASE
World worst program
Super
So   supr
Bf
I have to reinstall this all the time as it starts closing on its own, starts off as 20-something mb in size and shoots up too 300+ mb, terrible app, get it sorted!
Amazing for the family
Excellent
Nice
Please make the news feed updated to the most MOST RECENT stories NOT the (top stories). Listen to the users. Why you have to access the private messages of the phone? No way!
But nice
Good.
This new update doesn't work it goes  black & every time i start it no network dispkays.
Every time I search for my friends.  It gives me ten relative names but, when I click on show all. It gives me a lot of other names that aren't even similar at all.  Then I have to scroll down to find them. Fix it .
everytime session expired
Since the update it just says just a moment and nothing happens
Nice
It takes up a lot of space, and updates more then it should need to. & now it NEEDS Facebook Messenger to be installed in order to chat with friends. That shouldn't be a necessity.
Love
Why did you remove messager from the Facebook app? And put tracking software on your standalone Messenger app
I like  this stuff
App sucks
Love it
It Keeps Telling Me to Force close. Please Fix
X sedap langsung..lmbat install

I like this app
The app frequently freezes on the news feed and remains frozen after the app is restarted. Also disappointed that the messenger functionality now requires a seperate app.

Y
Its good u peeps might have bad WiFi connection
I dont like the way it force me to install fb messenger. It sucks
When I try to add somthing to my facebook it wants to sign in again when app is already running real pain. And far from all the problems with your garbage app. Do not have the time to go threw it all. And an over all rating of 4 is bullshit. I see way too many complaints to be a 4. Get it together. Not that you peanuts really view or comments.....
Sucks. Hangs like hell. Take its own time to start.
Really very good
good and nice

Good
wow
Film
Can't read msgs without the messenger!!! I don't like that stupid app bring back the simple messaging feature!!!!
I hardly use FB these days, to long winded, just loaded app and it won't allow me to login into my own account, put's me in an endless loop, uninstalled! waste of time. Web page doesn't take your updates besides like and dislike, am hardly on my PC, so don't update there, the whole process seems way to long winded, FB used to be fun, know just a chore...
Yes

Firstly your app sucks and the updates are making it worse. Secondly, you're not even working on making it better. I'm not getting back on facebook now.
Keeps shutting down on me...
Osem app
Simply awesome.I'm totally addicted to it.
Take time to load/configure or it shuts down. Apps that are connected to FB get stuck to
It automatically shuts down or the application just closes itself...
Would rate 5 stars but since the update when you go to do a status you can't change the privicy to (custom) which means you can hide your status from certain people no more
FB helps me to stay in touch on the daily coming and goings of family and friends near and far. It brought me back in touch with a very dear friend who I had no idea how to contact. Now we see each at least once a month if not more!!
L i k e  i t
Agree! The old version are better! :(
like..
Can't swipe to see next/prev picture since the last update. Previous version is better

Takes forever to load!!!!! Pleas fix and I'll give 5stars
I tried to update my old version of facebook but it usedvup too much memory and i can't open it. So I planned to uninstall it andvreinstall it again and again but the same thing keeps happening. Please fix this and I'll give you five stars.

Zero stars. The new update loaded and can't search for friends, they aren't there.  Can't post on their feed, etc.
Dai
It is a best way to connect with friends
As an app with one of the biggest userbase and i bet one with the largest resorces for development, this should be much better. Why does it rotate my screen when navigating inside the app? I have to rotate my tablet at the will of the app? Wtf?
Good
Nice sms chat
Nice
Every time I share something it sends me back to the top of my news feed then I have to scroll back to were I was
Slow as
Love this app.....
Mayzin
tnx
Not pleased about losing chat capabilities and being forced to download an additional app I do not like. Deleted messenger app, may delete fb app and use Web version only

Plz fix the bugs... Itz taking too much to load
Very good.usefull
Needs To Be Able To Move To SD Card, && Notifications I Liked When It Used To Read It Out On The Top Of Your Phone. & Links Don't Open In App Anymore, Which Was A Really Cool Thing
Ths version is quite slow. When I open, takes long time to open n after closing, I can't get notifications which is quite irritating. Want to go back to old version. Bt how????? :/
I love Facebook!  Our family has grown and some of us move on to greener pastures to find that we have increased in size and finding out you have been related to these guys and had no idea but its really nice!
C'mon facebook, you can do better than this!!!, the problem for me is that it never gives the right notifications. Like for example, it always says i have 15 new notif's. and tons of friend request's, but when i open the app....there's absolutely no notifications at all!!......If only i could give it ZERO stars, i would definitely do that....(p.s. you should really fix that and it takes up so much space in all our phones...what are ya tryna' do?!....kill our smartphones!!..
The latest update is not good. The app crashes when launched. Please fix this.
I always talk to my friends a lot and so the reward is 5 awesome stars!
Abuja
Nice app like it ..
Love it

I hate it please fix I can't see my normal messages it tells me I have to download the app messenger. I don't want to download messenger I just want to see my messages on the Facebook app itself!!!

Slow
This app helps to communate with each other
I have a nightmare when it comes to tagging etc just really glitchy and frustrating !
Many things in the Facebook is not available here and many bugs please use insecticide :)
Good morning

100
when I open this app it close I don't knowe what happen
No word to say...
The old facebook is better then this one. Since the update it makes my phone flat fast. -.- fix this bullshitup or els :L
App keeps closing itself out when I click on notifications. I've uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times.  Not getting any better.
Essentially the program which is the heart of face book is flaunted with errors or poor programing by the designers who are engineers and the technicians.They frequently ARE upgrading the programming trying to correct the underlying problems, which only contributes to the program.Just more inefficient stuff and more memory being eaten up ESPECIALLY those of us who like to use our phones.I do not use profanity but fb temps ME.there are daily issues BUT BY FAR THE MAJOR PROBLEM ARE YOUR COMMENTS DISAPPEARING
Its like your doing facebook on computers.. Its awesome :)
It's taking lot of time to download the photos. The previous version was far much better than this. Please fix it ASAP. I get 60mbps speed still it takes a very long time to show the uploaded photos.  It's very irritating to wait for the photos to show up while scrolling down.
Good fb ..
Last update is full of bugs!
Very slow n repeating same  information
The search was float
I like it because I meet my friends .and
Same as up

Worst app ever. Fix it

Excellent app
Waaaw
I can not update the app., once I finished downloading data of update it gives me a message of error and I have to delete prev. copy of facebook which I can not do it coz. the only options I got is either open or update the app.
Hey guys, have you ever considered integrating copy&paste feature in this app. Or is it too much for your little brains?
It loads image slow
Good best better
This update still make my phone, game and others app open very slowww. I'm not sure what's it do in my phone background but I confident it's only effect from Facebook sure. Fix it or bring back Facebook before 2 updated. Now...uninstalled
This app drains way more of my battery than it needs to. Needs more options for better or worse performance for user preference.
It's force close at my Samsung Galaxy Pocket!
Works fine on my phone but not on my tablet. I go to click on something and it closes instead, super annoying!
Past reaction
This app has ALWAYS been glitchy, and consumed too much memory...  but it was tolerable... now it won't even load, I will not be giving this app any more chances...best way to browse fbook is using dolphin browser
Take so much time to load

Great job on crashing upon message retrieval, requires rebooting and it never fails. Going via web sucks... Can t seem to be able to click on anything. Resest tablet and reinstall same thing. Facebook beacame history waiting for something else to come up. Thanks while it lasted.
3 stars because it eats a lot of RAM and drains my battery.
Ilove you

Bad apps now!!!!
Very fast and easy to handle.
The latest update seems to be a battery sucker. My battery is down nearly 70% in less than 8 hrs.  I looked at what was using my battery and fb was at 62%. With "stay awake" being the culprit.  Even though this was overnight while I was sleeping.  Fb shouldn't stay awake when I have the app closed. Not happy!
or in .  I have to use brower to get it to show at sll

for a new upgrated version
Fine
Thanks for shar
Still shuts down randomly on android tablet!!
What happened to shazzzaamm!!?? Lmao  :-V

Disappointed,  This App Use To Work Well,It Now Constantly Freezes, Then Your Page Just Goes Haywire, It'll Just Show A Scamble Of Your Page,Then It Just Shuts Down and I Have To Log Back In...FB I Would Love To Give It A Five Star, But Until The Problem Is Fixed A Two Star It Shall Be.,Get It Together FB!!!
seriously, why set the news feed to show top posts? and i have to go through the menu to see the most recent ones? that is just stupid. addendum: pictures are not showing, videos are not playing. so what's the use of this app then? Pictures still not showing. What's this useless app for?
Adhyatmikam
It keeps closing FIX IT
Only way to stop it running in the background is to end the process....Really annoying
It don't download yaar wat do i do know
Contact for production information.
Awesomeness
Its really awesome!!
It always lag my cp during new update.
I like it
cannot copy text elsewhere, from facebook. cannot properly arrange profile picture crop ...
I think i should delete this app what a rubbish update
wooh
Ashok
Great app
Every time I log in it says "error loading new feed" please fix this problem
good
Check messages  without  installing another app just to read messages, Ridiculous! We should have the option to  either get messenger  or just go to  our inbox !! PLEASE  CHANGE BACK !!
Nice apps
Dah lame tunggu app mcm ni.. Best!!!!!
Mas
Every time I logout from an acount and want to add a newone, it stucks and continues its stucking about 5 to 10 times, fix it !!
Everytime I want to upload a picture orbs video, it freezes. What a load of BS.
Happy with this
I love it
Too slow
Love it!!!
So, good
Difficult to say anything good at all. Little point in being able to 'like' or 'hide' a post if the app erases your action every time you close it.

It's best apps.
Love it
This is ridiculous. Android has been around for years now and I had the very first Android phone (G1) and had this app ever since. It has barely made any changes or improvements over the years. I mean there is not even an option on the app to see the "other" messages. I have to open the browser. It barely works on my phone. Locks up after a while so I can't do anything until I have to force close and reopen. At least 5x a day. I have to uninstall updates about every day because the new version doesn't work.

Nice
This shifty app has now a browser built in that no one wants. Gets shoved up your noses. Worst app experience ever!
When i want to see a link, which was shared by my friend, push the news link and it shows new blank, asks me to write url adress, when i want to go back it doesnt work and i have to push home button, to leave that page.
Loved it
Best way to meet our beloved ones anywhere

Thank you Facebook for the update. No more issues. Thank you for your quick response;)  You deserve a beer and five stars !

No emoticons in comment section. Ios version is having it. Please develop it for android as well.

Every time I try to open the app it automatically closes again its been like it for 2 days now!!!!
Superb
Not working properly

After this update.. Am not able to save pics.. Sucks!!
It's awesome!!
This is impossible. So slow and always crashing down. I'll just use my browser. And I hate fb messenger!! This should be uninstalled!! Boo!! Getting worst every update -_-
The way it was designed was just horrible. I'm only giving 1 star until you fix the terribleness that everyone hates
Keeps freezing!!! Come on..get it sorted!!
Ok
I uninstalled it because it wasn't working right.  After downloading again it won't open at all.
the application stopped working
Good
Nice strategy to get maximum download for messenger.but we will not download messenger for chatting.

SME tme itz nic bt nt dat mch
I like it thanks facebook
All you people complaining need to buy a decent phone. It's a fine working app and they're constantly giving us updates to deal with your complaints, which, are completely hardware (or lack of user intelligence) related.
Yololo
Never had problem downloading or unloading to reload my phone is huawei
its annoying
But what happened to the option of browsing inside facebook without using other apps? otherwise nyc
Everytime i click the photo of my friends, all i can see is black.   Fix this s**t .
At last I found it thanks to alls of you...
Because i can not down load it
Love it
Everytime i go on the app, it just automatically goes out again. Pls fix!!
Yaa

Please Add a button to Remove people in "People You May Knw" so that same people will not come on suggestions everytime.. Fb sud put new suggestions everyday in App and Web version too..
When i open the apps it closes
Great........  :)
Shortcut
Awesome
works nothing
Or at least give us the option to set it as default, it can't be such a hard thing to do, can it!?
Don't update the app if it will get worse. Just moment takes forever to load.
This app may caused retard ness because every time I open, its just saying "just a moment" then says Facebook isn't responding.. Getting sick of this.. Fixed it soon HQ!
Not working
Nice app
Can't log in, can't log out, when I finally do log out, it stays on logging out screen until I close app, then when I re open the app and try to log in, it says there is some error in logging in and to try later, been like this for two days, I deleted app re-installed, it let me log in, when i logged out, had same problem, had to delete again and I WILL not re install

Superb
I miss a lot of posts because nothing is in chronological order I totally dislike not seeing posts because of that. The fact I'm supposed to download a separate application and waste more space on my phone for chatting is ridiculous.  I do love being connected to people on Facebook.  Just want to see their posts when they post them not a month from now
This apps so good like fkermother
You keep me in touch with my friends world over. Thanks a lot for doing a great job

Just downloaded it and it's already lagging
Still keeps closing any time I try to click on a video, post a comment or status update  or move from my newfeed. Tried multiple times to contact FB for support with no acknowledgment or response...Support page also kept crashing. Finally had no choice but to un install from my tablet.

Best way to stay in touch with family
But i hope that the speed of this app remains constant
I love fb

A light weight version is appreciated or the current app should use less resources
Cool,i loved it,

absolutely gutted, what's happened with the facebook app?? Turns itself off, shows old posts, not impressed at all and will spread the word if not fixed soon!
I hate this app
messenger
Nice
Using nexus 5. Copy is not working ... Plz help me
I have updated on 2nd October,2014 its getting crashed frequently. If this is rectified then the app is great a very good one. I am using Samsung Note 2
The app worked fine untill a week ago, it goes to news feed but when u want to go to your profile or anywhere else it shuts down and goes back to your desktop am using samsung galaxy tab 10.1 uninstalled twice rebooted the tablet still same problem do u techs know what your doing? Uninstalling again and going to web goodbye 
Its taking more time to open the app and load the news feeds.
Just upgraded to this version, and my battery life went from three to only one day, and that's a phone with a 3300mAh, plus a 1300mAh power case.
I like it I guess
Dipti
I just can open the app after downloading it
Every time I follow a link out of Facebook then return to Facebook it's jumped to the top of my timeline. When I'm trying to catch up on unread posts this is infuriating!
Can't sync my contacts to my phone.

Ohhh

It doesnt work well,. It s annoying u know?....

Nice app why it is slow while downloading
The app crashes before even showing the homepage, has been so for a very long time. I hope this changes soon. Device is Cubot X6
Every time i open the app it's starting the setup again like after a fresh install.
Gjj G
It is slow and it contains too much space please fix this problem.
Every time I try to log in it refuses mxm tired of this
Hate
Arghh too laggy .. pls fix this
Nice facebook

Good
Love it
I can't see the thumbnails of profile pictures
Good apps
llike
wont let me have the play while scrolling down option
The feature of viewing pics on any person on their profile page by just swiping the cover pic - Was A Great Feature & I loved it as it didn't require Graph search (as it is done on desktop website). But it has been recently removed. Please bring it back.
Generally this app is easier on iphone. When trying to upload a photo from your gallery instead of taking you to your different galleries you have to find your pic from the camera roll. On iphone you get the gallery menu page to select/ navigate properly. This still works on whatsapp and other apps but not facebook where you have to spend ages searching though all the pics on the camera roll
Device not supported anymore. Bring back the previous
thanks for ds app!.
Every time I open the app it closes down and starts from the beginning
i dot like this apps
Good
you are simple manner,facebook!
Fabulous
Uggh soo like every  time I check my messages I get an  invite like to install Facebook messenger 
How can the biggest, most popular, PUBLIC OWNED social media outlet's app continue to be this unusable? Won't load, when it does it freezes, and I STILL don't care what you think my "top stories" should be! HOW CAN IT SUCK FOR SO MANY YEARS?! FIX IT!!!
facebook

The last two updates from today are the worst! Photos are taking time to load even you have a great data connection. It crashes everytime as well. I hope there's an app that would tell me not to update an app if it's working well and block those suggestions/notifications to update. -_-

Sangat bagus
This app always forcing me to install the garbage messenger which is already built in this app that's why I don't see any reason to install that trash, it must not mandatory to install the messenger because it's just too much consuming ram and making smartphones much more lag and I don't see any difference between built in messenger and messenger app. CRAZY!!!
No good
At its best!!!!
Since the new update it takes FOREVER to load up the app. Facebook worked fine before it.
Fac

Slow loading images.

Very bad app not reached expectations
I like Facebook a lot
This makes my phone works too slooooooww
Facebook
After installing new version opening app is a difficult task. Every time says" setting up Facebook".
Facebook
:D
Cooool
facebook
The update before this one, it would freeze. Simple fix was to close it and reopen. This update? That doesn't even work. Have to turn my phone completely off. And!!! When I leave the app, but don't close it, it will randomly open itself. LG G3
iloveyou so much
Facebook app is very good working on my galaxy Mobile but only one problem is scrolling problem
Hardly ever use this app. Pain in the butt to use the simplest of tasks. Usually use the desktop version of Facebook using the chrome browser instead.
Great app,  a must have.
Really like this app on my phone.
Since my kitkat update on my tablet, this app closes when I try to click on any picture or link. I can't even like or comment on a post without it closing. Please fix the compatible please!
app is so slow
It's sooooo easy nd saves tyme.. no need to go to Google nd search which takes lot of tyme... thx... u rock
Perfect
I can't log out my facebook account bexause
pls make this app be moved on  SD card
I like the app but it would be preferable to many if the messages could be retrieved directly from the fb app and the fb messenger app was  made optional.
Super
Just hate how this app takes so much time for initial startup
Fast
Great way of communicating
Too slow..
i love it bcoz it so easy too use and to reach people outside their.
Since this latest update, the app constantly crashes. I cant click on anyones profile etc or the whole app goes down. Please fix!
It's so much easier and faster than going through the browser
Dual core phones lag in messenger
Could be better
This is ok but it has over size 20mb
Interesting in life,

I love Facebook it a really nice way  to chat with friends and more.  I recommend everyone download this app.

Wont let me upload any videos
Ever since the last update Facebook keeps crashing.  Please fix this problem,  as I don't want to throw my tablet at the wall. But I will....

Pls add copy and paste option
Top stories first three items will be extremely dated and now irrelevant, yet if I scroll down 30 to 40 posts, I'll get breaking news. WTF?
Can i give it zero star..
Its a waste to use this app...
1. Messaging. Not downloading the 2nd app,  ever.  2. Randomly I'm being served full-screen adds now blocking everything I'm doing. I'm ready to deactivate my whole Facebook account.

Keeps locking up and shutting the app off after the latest update  fix asap I'm using a Samsung Note 2
Too slow, too large.
now its great!
The early versions of fb were Good but now its trash like the latest problem with it is that sometimes i can't login because of an unexpected error so everytime that happens i have to re download it.what a pain(--;)
Its Ok the app runs too slow
The only sad thing is people have lost the personal touch, now days none calls you for your birthday,  is all in Facebook ;-(
Fine
But slow
Good app for the Facebook page and social network
Facebook
Great
Sucks that you are forced to use messenger.  Liked the old way where you could do everything in the app.  I guess forcing you to use messenger is so they can spy on you.
Problem with logging out since the last update.
Very slow app improve application speed and there are more things that you have to notify
Mh,mehedi
crash all the time ..need to be fix
YA ALI MADAD
So you say that messages are now moving to Messenger from Facebook? Leave my privacy and my messages alone! Give me and a billion other people a reason to end the success of your business, I will be uninstalling every single application that you have brought out and that you're a part of if you don't make some serious changes ASAP! My Facebook keeps freezing and force closing, GET IT RIGHT DAMMIT!
Superb- self interactive
User friendly
App keeps crashing.  Tried sending email things and it appears to be getting worse. Uninstalled.
Love it
I was looking through the random list of strangers fb suggested I may want to connect with and came across a name that could have only come from the contacts in my phone. No thank you fb, I can do without the phone app.
Hi
This is basically just a copy of the social network from that movie. Either way it's good. Talk to your friends. I have like almost 24 friends. Needless to say, I'm pretty popular. - Philip Gonzales
I like that app
I  want you to stay keep the same profile in the past comment even though I change it now.
Cool
It so log
Go 2 ur setting on facebook and turn ur automatic video player off
Love it
News feed doesn't update like it should, app keeps crashing, friends profiles don't load.  It was working good until this last update.  Please fix!
Nice
Really changed the we get connected to each other in this complex world
It's raw I take photos and post them
Poor service....my Facebook not open...because of unsported error...y??
Poker
Best wishes to Facebook members
Very usefull to launch fb
The more you update this app, the more shittier it turns into.. It takes like years to display any new feeds.. Fix it asap
Awesome
It keeps saying trying to connect but never loads
Love the app and the improvements just keep getting better and better
Bad aap
I have no problem with it.
3 star is enough
EVERYTIME I PRESS THE MESSAGE OR THE NOTIFICATION BUTTON, IT EXITS!!!! I HATE THIS! THIS SUCKS!
Stop with the daily update!
Maybe I just don't have the patience to figure out how to get something you've liked to quit popping up in notifications. It's annoying!!!
What have you done.../:-) The app:@ is again and again hanging.. It is taking time to get open... Roll back to older one or fix it..:@ zero....
By using fb app we can chat easily and on low data cost
1. Comments appear when I click/tap on photos or videos. 2. Videos and photos load slowwwww unlike other apps like Instagram or Twitter. 3. It keeps on crashing. And I haven't done anything yet. I just opened it.
Its not even starting after updating stuck at setting up Facebook screen.. I tried clearing data but no luck :(
Love this
Good
Goood
It didn't alert me with notification tone ...it just vibrating and blowing led when new message arrived. Got mess up with this things. Fix it soon
Bad
Every time i open this app all I can see is a loading screen and then it says facebook has crushed please fix this problem.
Two thumbs up!!!!
Jayanth & Atul
As usual,  the new update SUCKS AND TOTALLY FUCKED the normal useful program. Thanks, Morons!
Its good but it cannot move sd storage
Its the best
Fb update to get better not more worse. I have to wait for a blank screen  while this this freezing my whole phone
V v v nice

This app has not opened since I updated it on Friday. It deserves no star,at all.
Like this......
Last update makes photo viewer run slower
Ok
Every time i try to share or like something in closes. What's up with that?  This app stinks!
this need  fixing is so bad on my s2
It is toooooo.... slow.... :-(
Fun stuff
I loved it
Awesome to associate wit ur friends

So
The newest one is actually quite stupid plus messenger being separate now is just b.s.and freezes up on everything i use it on
Whenever I go places or when I log on to the computer then it messes up and I always have to change my password so please take out the update or something
there are many problems that people have been complaining, honestly the only thing making me want to stop using it from time to time is the fact you can't make you're newsfeed be on recent instead of "popular", I don't care about what a friend said 2 weeks ago, and that I've seen that post when they posted it
good but not best
It always closes on me when do any action
Lol
It takes forever to open the app when I updated it! I shouldn't have done that!
Everytime I click a link the app crashes.  Tried reinstalling. ..did not fix.  Not functional.
Grrrrrr....!!!!
Keeps me close to the ones we love, and doesn't slow me down!!
App works great!
Cool
EXCELLENT
Always Facebook isn't responding and always hard to login..
OK type gets stuck u guys need to update a better version
free
Its ok ok
Its this and that
The app won't let me load any page.  Then I uninstalled and reinstalled the app,  it came across as an error.
Despuez de la ultima aztualizacion me pidieron mi ID algo que me reuso a dar trato de dar mi telefono pero es imposible ami me gustaba face hasta la ultima aztualizacion a si que ya saben no voy hacerme una cuenta de face nueva por que tengo una y si no arreglan eso creo que la opinion de 5 estrella va a bajar
Facebook
Drains battery like crazy. With the app installed I only get about 12 hours. Without the app I comfortably get 20 hours.
I have a zte and after the last update it won't load. I'm really mad
This app sucks -_-
Why does it freeze and close all the time this is very annoying fix it please.
Si la berdad .es bueno
What error (920) download this app
Its good app
Every time I try to open something or  click on a link the app shuts down
Pink
I have unistalled. Whatever the developers did is preventing the app from working on a tablet. Sometimes your upgrades are really not upgrades.
I love it
Awsm app
Great app. I appreciate not needing to open a browser to access my account. I rarely have trouble using this app which says alot about the dedication the team working on it has considering how many people use it. Thanks guys!
Not faster in my mobile
The video just stops the last 3 seconds of it and when minimize facebook and go back to it goes to the top of my news feed and not where i left it from.....!?
Abid
Crashes every time I open a link in my Facebook newsfeed.  Gs5
Dont care for the new message
News paid
Can't click links now without the app shutting down.
Those of you don't know what I mean by love dead well just listen I got about 5 times on this website on a game the house of love this app
Found it swest
Update
It used to be good years ago, now it is too intrusive, eats battery even when all notifications are off...and now FB forces me to download a messenger I don't want. Bye FB.
Even tho it takes forever to load the newsfeeds..I still love it tho..
I've been having loads of fun with it... Great
Goof
Love  face book
its juzz slow..... uses a hell lt of intrnal memry....
Although d app is awesome... It is my best tym pass..d functions r well setted moreovaa scurity is also at d best level
Uninstalling.   Closes every time I click on a link.  Can't read comments on posts and can't look at friend's pages without the app closing.  Samsung Galaxy tab.

Facebook too good.

Facebook

Takes up too much space
But messenger compulsory is irritating...consumes lot spaces...
So sick of face book and this crappy app that never works on the first try.
Not much ofba fan of Facebook
Facebook
Photon droid.  Latest updates a P.I.T.A!!!!
Live free
Gb
News feed doesn't update any more. Can't use this anymore
Facebook
I always get a grey screen everytime i close it, then open it again... Also, it keeps on reconfiguring itself EVERYTIME... Please fix
It's beautiful
On launching the Facebook app, the settings screen is opened and then the app is closed automatically. I am using 4.4.4 KitKat with android run time and not dalvik
Every time I rate this it goes back to the rating I gave ages ago - a few more stars. Guess they need all they can get so they have to cheat. Every update it gets worse!!!!! Now keeps trying to force Messenger on me which I despise. It's as messed up as FB. See if this rating stays on here. Would rate - stars if I could!!!!
Always resets to "top stories" and I have to keep choosing most recent. Super annoying. Automatically plays movies unless you tell it not to. Etc.
Nice
T complicado.....
It's a great app
Garbage
Every time I try to log in, it says that my accout doesn't exist!.
I cannot open it immediately. It takes so long to open...it always says "one moment."
When scroll down for news feed it works very slow and its shows Photos,news only loading loading doesn't open pics really it s****
I gve it 4 stars its a common app
It keeps shutting down has been doing this after the last update over it!!!
Goooooood
Thank you Mark for connecting me to my friends and family :) I enjoy your work and through your improvements facebook has gotten better and worse it one way or the other.  Have a good day even though you will never see this. :)
Pls fix the log out process. It keeps going back again and again on the news feed. All I keep doing is clear data .. Pls fix. Ty.
I wish there were a permanent way of keeping the "most recent stories" option than having to go to my side bar every single time...
Good app
This is very best Abb for socialising
Do not move all messages to messenger. I dont want another app clogging up my phone. Its already slow enough with facebook being the biggest app, using the most background data, most battery, and nearly most mobile data. I dont use it much. Will defiantely unistall if I must have two apps to messange
Four stars
Its...awesome...
This is very beautifull
Bad experience
But do not allow sex material to be shown so that you. You can reach perfection. Thanks
I like this app I like and I don't see what other people think is wromg with this app so other people just getmover it is just an app you can uninstall this app so quit whining and get overnit!
Slow loading & fails to connect
Excellent
Give me back my messages.
Great communication

Facebook application is not as fast as it was....
Happy man

Need to have the old Facebook message system again.
Consistently crashes since most recent update.
It is faster than all apps
Crap!
Last update sucks....
Eversince the upgrade to kitkat FB keeps closing off when I click on a link , hope you can fix this , very frustrating !!
i cant move to my sd card
Not responding almost all the time
Ok so when the new update came to my phone. facebook is now not responding, automatically shutting itself down and/or freezing up all of the time. So much that I am about to just Uninstaller it completely for good unless you programmers can fix this problem.
Eating my data. . Very bad
don't like Facebook messenger, remove that notification that asks to install messenger instead of showing messages.
Takes too long to download I really don't talk to the people friends or family on here like I thought I would no one really like any comments posted on there I don't see why I bother with it
Loved it
Its so very slow! You better fix it now!
Thanks
Getting an unknown error message while trying to download Facebook app
Very slow.......:-(
While changing the profile picture, even if we select a preexisting photo, it creates a new copy of it
I keep getting stupid messages from people idk from my messages y'all need to fix the bull
without fb now a days life is impossible....all my friends and family are always connected with me...it's the best source of news from around the world...loved it
Really this app is excellent

Awful battery drain
LAG!
I love it
Awesome
It keeps on saying setting up facebook
Love it
It takes forever to load. What kind of improvement is this? I wouldn't be surprised if another social network like this rises up.
Needa make it easier to delete messages. Needa way to delete multiple messages at one time, and it should delete the messages that are in the fb message app with it. Tired of havin to delete from both apps.
Slow!!!! All I can see is the old post!!!! Please fix it and I'll give it 5 stars!
Everytime I open this Facebook App it hang-up & my phone is logging. Its been a long time that I dont use my facebook because of this problem. Pls fix this ASAP!
Due to this I have experience tremendous amount of lag on my  otherwise lag free Nexus 5.

fine
Great app
Frequently it crashes....
Since latest update it force closes on my phone, can't even get past loading screen.
So did y'alls stupid update and now it won't let me log in keeps force closing I have a coolpad phone please fix.
i like it...!
Love it.
Govind Kumar
It good but it was asking crop photos
Every time I log out I get this thing saying I can't because of some reason and my Facebook got hacked because of Facebook message
I got a friend request from someone today who did not send it! Uninstalling due to Facebook's blatant invasion of privacy.
Can zoom on pics. All updates make it less functional.
Dean
This App was great, but since the last update I can't access Facebook from the App. I unnistalled and try to install it back and it doesn't let me. And the few times it let me install it, I can't access it.!

More add
Info
Awesome
Ok so i use it everday. And it takes up so much bludy space. Its annoying.  As takes up most of the room. On my  phone expects me to update it every week. Its a pain if i could give u 1 half of a star i would.
Had the app worked fine at first then stopped lettin me sign on . F**K Y*U app maker .
How can facebook not yet realise that we dont give a shit wat the top stories are ...we want the most recent to be the news feed we see straight away. OH... and i have to uninstall at least 3 times a week cause somehow facebook uses 200mgb of my fone space and then if i clear cache the app wont open again. This has got to be the most retarded shitty app ever!!
Cant Downloaddddd it
Updates sent out kill the app entirely. Seems like it needs another update.
Super
Still wish there were not SO many LOADING ISSUES! :(
Every week their is a new update and every week it takes up more space on my phone. Pretty soon their will be only room for the Facebook app. Seriously... Calm down buddy!!
Super
Nice but it cannot be moved in sd card and taking space in device.  Thats bad
:-\ uck
Many updates, many loading happens. 
What can I say, except it's a miracle!
It sucks
Excellent
Grate
I got tired of it closing on me all the time. Couldnt scroll, open posts or leave posts with it crashing constantly. Fix these issues and I'll reinstall app.
Thanks FB its working now:)
I don't want this option, every time I set it, it automatically goes back on.
Like the. Message with friends
So nice,but no speed in sometimes...sometimes system may hang
Still not giving you the option to sort by most recent
Nic
Facebook is cool
ryadh
Too many invasive permissions. Slow. Unstable. Uses too much data
Works good
Trying to log in and saying just a moment. For half an hour. How am suposed to log in. Wish there a zero. Shouldn't take half an hour to an hour just a moment. Ahh so over it!!

Has its up and downs
updated to this version and it sucks!!!!...freezes and shuts down all the time....sucks!!!
Mmmm just not there yet 
Gud
Have to go to settings evertime and set to sort feed chronologically.  Samsung galaxy s3
Messagenr
ilove it
This app used yo be great. I've had it for years, but now it's slow, uses alot of space, feeezes, stops, shuts down, etc, and takes forever to do anything. Unacceptable. Galaxy s5
Hoo
Hohohi
Every time I tap to look at something on facebook it takes me out and i have to go back in from the beginning.  Really hate Facebook
Have been partner to message my mother.
The app works ok, dislike being forced to install messenger, preferred the messages staying in FB. It's FB making the annoying changes like forcing popular stuff to the top of the news feed while you're trying to look through it and it keeps bringing you back to the top when you don't want to look at the same stuff over and over again.
I like facebook. To use it need to much memories space and friends also limited 5000. If more then 10,000 or 20,000 it's will better.
Too stiff n stuffy
Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Messenger
it is cool
Update it it keeps crashing -.-
Love it
Slow amd laggy on Xperia Z1. Stores 110mb of data on phone, clearing data speeds things up for about 2 minutes. Then lag returns.
Nic
Just really lends itself to disappointment,vetu poor,you would think that the "best" ??technology team(yea right) could possibly fix a very poor app.?? Again your team sucks ...Zuckerman you are,well,basically just a genuine failure to the public..shame on you
Buset
It is always crashing when trying to access another profile or whatever you click on, I can't wait till everyone dumps this crap of a app.
Love it
I like very much.
Can't even delete this app!!!!!!
Good

Good
The last update is messed up... won't let me see the chat line and the times when my friends were last on.
Nice
Messanger download sucks f**k this apps.. forcing us to download..
I can open the Facebook but not responding...again and error, please don't notify update!
New update is garbage. When app launches grey screen or loading takes at least 1 minute. Slow is an understatement.
I uninstal it All time not responding so even i cnt use other apps properly coz fb stuk all. More over it occupy alot memory n for private msgs i have to instal messenger also for God sake reverse ur updates n give us old fb which was far beter
You should update for the  better , not for worse
It always crash and too! many updates.. and its slow!
"-23" error
This app is so good u also try this
Ilovethis
I rate this app 1/2
Memory eater

Why is it everytime i open it appears facebook isn't responding fixed it guys
Yuyu ki
Totally waste , worst app lot of lagging
Nick zuckenburg
I liked
Latest update causes my app to load extremely slow. Wait a moment is an unserstatement. I'd rather load the browser version if it buffers like a video. The app itself also crashes either upon load up or during use. Your messenger app suffers similar problems.
why
Good
Don't let me upload. Fb it says. Incompatible. Update.
Hmm... Not bad!
This app is so lame I can get on the internet
I loves this app
Haven't  got in my face book page
Not that yall care anyway. I refuse to install messenger. I'll just use the safari. You can't comment on someone comment like you use to. And if I have to go to tab on more time to see most recent updates I'm going to flip. It's obvious the creators of this app are retarded. Every update it gets worse. That says a lot about the creators.
my love bangladesh
All the updates have ruined this app.  It's force closing all the time,  stop on the middle of scrolling down my news feed and don't let me start on the space that it keeps taking more and more of. .. fix this PLEASE!
Nice
This update resolved everything that I wanna it to resolve
On
Facebook failing status updates and comments
I like this app
why should use messenger, not effective
It won't download
This apps bring closer to your friends
fast speed
Crap...to many update...disturbing my privacy when im trying to fuk girls
Latest updated made the app totally stop working??
The app is good, but I would like it better if the Birthdays was at the top of the screen instead of in events. If you don't click on events tab and go to Birthday's it is easy to miss someone's Birthday. Though, other than that the app is very good and definitely one to put on your phone.
Great, fast and simple to use. Its not as good as the computer though.
Great job, u actually freeze my EVO LTE and I need to shut it down to unfreeze it...ZERO stars...how bout an update, its so slow even on WiFi and keeps loading and loading and loading 9/29/12
Too much memory
Its help me a lot

Im gonna give yah  5  starts if you fix it well   Rp naeun pabuh son XD
Good aaps
Love
If I log in once, then I go and log out, the app stays on the logging out screen, and won't go into the login screen again until restart my phone. I had done an uninstall then reinstalled it again but it still does it and has been for a week. If I leave it on the logging out screen, it seems to zap my battery.  Please fix.
Good
It tries to b smarter than the user and needs more privacy options. Don't wanna waste time explaining FB what thy need to do. Horrible messenger.
Does not let you log out unless you delete the app. And I'm sick and tired of doing this just to log out bye bye facebook! Kills battery too.
Helps you stay connected...
Buggy update - quits on startup
Takes up.space and.without the messenger app I can't read my personal messages.p.o.s..
Very use
Improving with times..
Most Recent posts must be the first to show up on the News feeds screen. I feel bad when I open it then all I see is the past posts of others. So eww! Fix That!
Nyc
It takes up wayyy too much space.
Dog hunched over
Since updating to KitKat, on Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. Keeps randomly crashing which is anniying to use.
Por favor arreglen ese problema del chat, aparece como activo aun cuando esta opcin apagado
palitha201491
App takes up too much room with all the updates.  Is freezing now.  my Samsung S4 does not like this app.  I don't have Trouble on any other app only this one.
I just updated this app and now it closes on me!!!
gamed fsh5
It helps me keep in touch with family and friends.
Jk
Nice App
I agree with everyone if I could give zero stars I would ...it won't let me play any videos that get shared but for some reason keeps opening them and draining my battery..... Absolutely pi$$ed
Too much lagging
Absolutely hate the new app Hogs memory and very intrusive! Give us the old update back!!!!!
Since yet another update, my news feed is totally out of time/date order. Please fix asap it's really annoying!!!!!!!
First you require messenger and now all these updates?! It just takes up space! You're pushing up back to MySpace.
It not so bad
nice
"Dis new version is slower to run than the other one.
Since I update this app its stopped on just moment wtf..
Going on good
ang tagal
I have no problem with Facebook at all. I love the videos playing. I am having trouble with the translating, as I have many Arabic friends, and I can't read it. But, besides that, all is just peachy!!
Latest update fails to show updated comments or like count below original posts from friends.
I would imagine the world's most well known social network app would be reliable and simple to navigate but no. Also tends to take unreasonably long to load images, videos, etc... at times even when on a decent connection. Only reason this is used is because it is the "trend" and largely serves no realistic social gain to certain age groups. Nice to connect or find distant friends though. Can't think of anything else good to say about this.
How long must I wait for your updated pgm finishs setting up? Still full of "bugs". Guess I'll have to use a PC to access the site. This is really zero stars for this Facebook app.
Love it

This app sucks! I have to take out my battery on my phone every time after being on to reset my phone because it won't log me out.
V v Good app face book.
Every time I post something it crashes
Don't know what everyone's issue is. I've never had a single problem with the App and it's the only way i get onto Facebook
Love It
Its suck jus occupied a lot of space and to slow i like the old version
I love it cuz like i get to comunicate with my friends and family
Facebook had updated so many times lately and each time it's got no better. It freezes, videos dont play/stop half way .. And most importantly it takes up too much space! Each time I update the app, I have to delete other apps before to create space .. Not good enough! REDUCE THE MEMORY SPACE!
Kinda slow...
Are the best
This app sucks keeps crashing when i try to open notifications
awd
Come on Devs....test it before you issue updates. App opens like an old computer... then says it's not responding.
Every time I try to go to a friend's timeline, it kicks me.  Or, if I click on a pic, it kicks me off.  Please fix, I'm sick of this.
Too much memory
Makes my phone run wicked slow and updates too often. Only works when it wants too. Very temperamental.
I have a Samsung tab 3 and every time i start Facebook it dies within 30 seconds . what the heck did you do in the last update? Please fix this quickly.
Gud app
It sucks
Ag
Its very good
Mary g
Keeps logging me out
Too many updates and overall size consumes so much space & RAM ...
Cool
Sap
this version is not installing on my androi.
This app absolutely sux on galaxy tab 3.  I closes every time click on a link or try to post.

Why so many updates? Some of us don't have the new iPhones or the biggest storage space for Memory.Barley want to use the app now. Just as soon as I learn the adjustments on the updated app, I have to update it again.. When u made us download a whole separate app for fb messenge, it added a ton of memory on my phone,with it not being a newer HTC it jams up everywhere. Sure u have ur reasons, but messenger worked fine on the fb app. Everything I ever used on fb app is tha same as New Messenger app..
awesome
The worst application.
Still half stinks.
I love all somalia
Okkk
Its amazing
wow
So easy to use and it is free

Fun
Great ways of keeping in touch with my Ohana
Too many updates. Everything very slow. Screen freezes. Please fix.
Hey Facebook..I'm really glad to have shared all my bloody details with you just so that I could be in touch with my friends..now you can too.
cant login my fbk acct ...it keeps returning to the to tje app wen ever am trying to login from my tecnoR7
It will not let me download more than 93% grrrr
I wish you would change it so you can sort your newsfeed, I still see posts from 2 weeks ago as new
ITS WORKS SO GOOD WITH MY SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB PRO
I would have given 5 stars....d issue wat I am facing is the messenger ......m not able to open d message without installing the messenger....der r ppl who dont have requirement of messenger who dont chat much.....and when I have to see msg sometime I get no option but to install the messenger......other option of opening facebook in a browser and look out for d message is hectic....plzz keep an option for either installing the messanger or continue wid d facebook app...dat would be helpful.
Always isnt responding when i update it please fix it
My phone's memory is taken up whenever I download an updated facebook app.
Why i cant upload videos. Its just simple videos and not abusive. Please fix it.
Gray screen wtf
Facebook is unhelpfull
Took some time to get used to the new look and feel but now i can say thank you Facebook for the app.
Very good
Website
It's so awesome and I can do anything kinda ,but it's still fun.
I am not able to open my Facebook from my Samsung galaxy phone.
I have the moto x and I don't have the option on the app to sync with my contacts!
Wish I Could Access All My Videos! :/
Everytime i click a link or try to move off of news feed it shuts off/closes. This has been happening since my tablet upgraded to kitkat. Is it that it is not compatible? Fix those issues then i can change my rating.
It works a bit slowly on my phone, and doesn't allow me to tag anyone with 3 letters within their names (that is Sam, Jen, etc.) but a nice app in general. But I give it 1 star, shoulda 0 star if possible, because of the MESSenger thing. Way annoying and tooooo much space!
it sucks! too large in space and yet too anoying to use!
Soooooper
Updated this and my messenger doesn't work. I'm pissrd off with these updates .  please sort them both. Can't access message from Facebook.. It's crap I'm sorry please sort it.  Had no orobs teo weeks ago
The status loading never happens.. it stays loading. And when I pass videos it pauses and I have to turn off my phone. Now its logging me off I just had to redownload this app
when im gonna open my fb it takes few mins to open,it always say setting up ang just a moment...kaasar
Another crap "update". What'd they do, change one line of code and reissue the same junk? I don't use Facebook much on the website, but I was on it every day on the app. Now that the app isn't even usable with freezing and force closing constantly. I haven't been on Facebook in days. So good job Facebook! You're driving me away from using any of your services. How a big company like Facebook can put out such a terrible app is just unacceptable. I'll just keep giving 1 star till it's fixed.
So laggy on the Sony xperia z. Makes it annoying to use
Connecting to my love ones
g
I like it
The most colest social network
No need to get computer and see all posts and not same in other because they say more MB 185 its only 20mb lagging no black out no and freeze no stay saying just a few minuets yes
You listen to no one. Never fixing things. Never getting it sorted. People are sick of this. People are leaving Facebook. Wake up Facebook. Your running your company like a info grabbing puppet instead of a great social network. Wake up Facebook.
Good

Krazzykat

App on Galaxy Tab 3 closes automatically all the time.  Has been doing this for 2 months now with no fix from fb.  Many posts have been requested for the fix... still nothing - crap.
This app uses up to memory, and when i run security scan, it says using to much CPU and lagging.
Good in services
This app crashes EVERY time I try to open ANY link.  I can't search for other pages.  This needs a major debugging.
News feed sucks. Thanks for finally showing a post 7 days later
I can talk to my friends!!!
I Like The New Design But Not The Fact That I Cant See The Most Recent Post. need Somthing New PLEASE Fix This Asap
When I try and scroll comment look at a page my Facebook freezes or crashes.  I thought it was me but reading the reviews I see it's not. .Must've been an error with a recent update but your getting a 1 star because you've done NOTHING to fix it.
But frezzes up my phone with messenger.
It want to much space :(
Nice
Huna
Lenta ad aprire il post . Molte  aggiornamento  pero sempre peggio . Tantissimi Bug  Galaxy note 2
It took way too long
Very good
This app no longer works on my galaxy s4 it doesn't even load anymore
Facebook
Love it
Sucks
Really grate
Very underwhelmed. Keeps crashing.  Needs major work.
App keeps closing on my phone. No "Others" folder in mobile app so missing some msgs. Also not a  recent feed. Seeing statuses from a few days previous every time I scroll down. Ugh
Gee still no fix for the Samsung galaxy tab 3 10.1
new update
Good
Facebook needs to stop constantly updating stuff, just because it's new, doesn't mean it's better
Apps ok if it would not take all my data.
It's sucks me everytime I open this App...JUST ONE MOMENT PLEASE? A very long Moment.. Grr... And the MBs is getting higher and higher and it leads to Memory Full!!! ****
Its a lovely app, but I can't seem to log in. I've tried reseting and reseting, but it just isn't letting me in.
Loved it
Love it
Force closes every time since the updates.uses too much space.pity I can't uninstall
good
Old version is best its so boring man
Great
Unable to share posts and links to private messages or to a friend's inbox.
It takes up so much space on my fone man. ... dang so very much space.  I can only have 1 game that i can play, and would LOVE to play two more that i would  LOVE to play but i can't because with Facebook it takes up all my space. 
Very much laggy app.Pls just fix it
Before my android hydro had no issue but now i struggle just to open the app it just says facebook is not responding then closes i need my facebook to talk to certain friends and family this app is nothing but a headache for me
they need to fiz it , it moves slow
The update did not fix my previous problem. It made it worse! I can only open my FB for ten seconds the closes! Please fix because it makes me ANGRY. (0 stars if I could)
Perfect for me
It's very good
Why I cannot reply on comments ..... 4 stars -_-
Fantastic
This update keeps bringing me back to playstore instead of opening the App...Fix this soon facebook
Works well..
Facebook is cool
After recent update fb closes randomly. It's annoying especially if im doing something on fb. Update sucks. I'm about to un install this app
Bestie
Lol
Takes to much memory
Love it!
When you use the app in landscape mode it's basically useless. You should think about making it like Google +'s landscape mode, which is much more useful.
the facebook is the next world we cant express how wos the thought firt.

My phone storage is getting low for always updating.. what i did is to turn off d notification.
faster faster faster
The app is getting too huge and unusable on older and low-mid ranged devices of nowdays... making it practically unusable.
Force to close app
Honestly, I ront know if its the App or the OS. It worked fine then my Samsung Tab 3 automatically upgraded from Android 4.2.1 to 4.4 and facebook has gone haywire since
it takes a lot of time to download but it is nice
I got to communicate with my friends
Please fix so I can see my videos on the app .
There's room for improvement, such as less glitchy performance. Overall, solid app
Nice app
/.^
Good
Y'all should change that, Why would y'all want us to wait 60 days to change our name that's messed up!
Facebook
It keep stopping and does not want to work
Easier to use on my mobile. Glad I  downloaded  it.
Why doesn't the space required for dl show anymore until after you start the process
Great Man at the Moment .
This app is trash right now always crashing and doesn't let you know when you have notifications
Does what it should, but it's too heavy and slow. The interface has been the same for a while, which means 'Ok'. Forcing users to install the Facebook Messenger App to be able to send & receive messages is a strong down side, as for me, this app is also too heavy for its purpose.
It crashes and force closes all the dang time.
The new update sucks notification makes the app closed
SN
Jes
Every time when I open it . it takes to many time. Sometimes even it jam not working plz fix it quickly...
Horrible. Forecloses constantly some days. Like today. Just horrid.
Scrolling always hang on my galaxy s3 very slow app.
I enjoyed
Love it
Last update mess up FB, not good at all, asked for repair but never happen!!! Keep frozen even OS
Gooood
It is beatifull
Nice facebook
Very slow when using and force closes when taking forever to load
Great
Take,s up a lot of room on your device run,s slow and close,s update,s but see no improvement in performance
I've been using facebook for android for a long time, and it has come a long way. Keep up the great work please :]
AFTER NEW UPDATE I CAN'T OPEN MY FACEBOOK APP,Please FIXED IT now??
Thanks For your application
Nice
It doesn't even want to open -_-
Awsome

Once again facebook messes things up. Cant get most recent stories. Its pure random like 4 hours ago then next one is fron 4 days ago then one hour ago etc. Now when on someones page etc I cant access my notification etc
Good
FB
Every time I try to open a picture, play a video or type a comment the app closes and brings me back to my home screen. Very annoying and time wasting. Uninstalling.

Since new update Facebook does not even work anymore. Says just a moment when loading and then goes back to my home screen. Also is unresponsive and asks If I want to report it or wait for it to respond. Uninstalled and reinstalled app but did the same thing
CARO

Its too bad.....

Nice for saving time.. it works fast
Why the hell hidden posts don't stay hidden in news feed?
Too many updates and so much does not work or has changed

No update your time west
Good app to connect with relatives and friends old and new.
Just got it seems hood
Since the last update i can't post in any group i get an error sayin im blocked - why?  :(
aps aps
No way to get rid of posts I do not want to see.  I click "I don't want to see this" and it goes away.  But next time I open the app it's still there, I can't get rid of them.  Not an issue on my laptop, only on my LG G2.
Like
Good Good Good
Way  Facebook way
I love this app
All I get is a blank screen .I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times and it still won't work
I Love It
El amor
It wont let me sent more friend request
Fun to just see
so cool

Good
With all the changes in privacy and facebook is controlling the feed to your page, who needs big brother. App should be renamed to stab users in the back book.
Keeps shutting down for no reason.
Suparb softwear
It's slow, logs out on its own and freezes. You would think when they update the app, these problems would get fixed. My other apps work great! Even with a new phone, this app still sucks. This is the only app I have that doesn't work properly.
Would like to be able to copy and paste status' from mobile, not just comments.
I love it
Shame
Im in love with this app #addicted
excellent
Awesome app I must say.I use this very much. This is my only way to have something interesting.I lovely to make friends. I love it.But its very difficult to download. A whole day will be need to download it. So embracing.
Every time I go to post something it shuts off. I go to post on some other wall and the same thing happens
Considering an alternative to fb to keep in touch with my freinds!
Great
My facebook keep crashing, everytime I click on someone's name!
It's ok but old
best app
Try these
Everytime I go to my news feed, it's all older posts. I have to go to "recent" in order to see posts from the rest of my friends or anything new. Why can't it all just be on my regular news feed?
but it would be more cool if u don't need WiFi to use it
Please fix the crash and log in
We use this aap n u
Tagging is missing needs to up grade.
Good no great

Be careful. Easily hacked!
Yipeeeeee
Superb

I love this app
Tired of the constant updates that doesn't make sense. All it does is used up more and more of our data plan.Have they ever taught of allowing us to keep  old  blog History.
Not very goodnot very bad
One Of The Fundamental things
Total waste.does not respond.after being logged out m unable to login again.poor Facebook
Half of the time it crashes 'facebook has stopped' fix it.
;)))
Why i Can't replay on comments ?
I hate it! I have a galaxy 3 note and pictures and videos take forever to load if they do at all.  And it's every time I go to Facebook.
,
Love it
Worst too much off space
This new app is crashing everytime I try to open it. I wish there were a 0 rating.
Slower then anything! Doesn't show feeds correctly. Just plan horrible!
Nice app I mean everybody likes facebook
Most recent posts are from 4 or 5 days ago, try to refresh, and it shows older posts. Fix please!!
Meh.
..
Excellent app
I got it
I've gone from Apple to Android and are very annoyed.  Why can't I choose to include or exclude a few friends when publishing or sharing a post. With Android it's all or nothing. Please add this function to the app.
I have recently updated my app. I now can't log in
Its background is white i want it black
I love keeping up with my friend and family....and being nosey!!!! Lol
Great service !
U are awesome
Im happy
If u have a little phone or a cheaper one u cant have fb
Good app
Crashes all the time
Please fix this issue.
simply loved it
Crashes every now and then, video automatically plays up when you scroll down .. Pathetic update.
Sucks dick
I just want messages to be separate frm messenger. Give d option in our hands to take over d messenger if required. Application crashes often while typing msgs. I hate messenger in facebook.
Good
Download hi hota
Facebook is the best web page forever. Love it! <3
This is nasty!! Famous story instead of recent story??!!! I better find another app
Fb has really done horrible with its updates.
So cool
So nice                             Hohoho
It sucks!
Excellent

What has happnd to new update, it has made this app super slow.. Plz fix the bug asap..!!
Nice
Taking too much space but good.....
Why is this app so big? 58 megabytes is stupid. Guys, come on. At least attempt to compress your apps before sharing them to 7,000,000,000 people. The space this app takes up is outrageous and needs to be sorted out so people can use Facebook without having to worry about your phone storage. I am a Facebook user, and it is a useful tool. I can chat with friends and whatever. But its too much space. Fix and I will rate *****!!
I dont like this...
This is the best app i've ever found on google playstore..:D
I'm tired of updating this every time I turn around
This app is a very reliable in our decade today ,because most of the other users they dont realy understand for what is the real esence of this appl....
Drchan
Won't let me message anyone with the new update
Welcome to all
I love it
Love it
The facebook on this app is better than on the internet
Heavy, generates lots of cache data... And hating that they want to FORCE people to install their messenger
Facebook
Good
Disgusting
Waste a crazy amount of memory with each update and need so much permissions to work
You just have to install the Facebook messenger to even check the messages. As if the app didn't have enough drawbacks.
Love it
Exlent
Your privacy settings are restricted. Editing is so cubersome.
Updates too much
Nobody happy with this application why ? Because it is taking so much space  . Eating more data  . Newsfeeds are bad. I have like many pages but can't see updates from them .
I am out of words
Its too bulky kindly see to it .plz I think U HV To make less bulky ...requesting u plz make sure that user should be happy not disappointed from ur app

New update REALLY SUCKS it always Crash.
I LIKE. THIS. APPLICATION. :) 
Love it
It doesn't respond and always force closes since the time that I updated the app. Now I have removed it from my phone and downloaded it again, hoping for it to function better unlike before. Hope you can do something about it. Update is really not that good this time.

King
I like ittt
I'm starting to get very irritated that almost ever time I use the app it comes up that it stopped working and to force close it
Needs to be fixed... Update plz
tear down the update! TEAR DOWN THE UPDATE. I want to actually be able to see my friends post. Not a day later
FB.. I don't like to know every notification on someone's status.. "Turn off notification" is a waste.. Pls do something about it.
I hate this app, it's make my phone slower and using much Ram , i don't believe it ask me down Facebook message
Jose
If FB wants us to use messenger,  then why the heck do they leave the message icon in this app,  remove the icon,  and remove the feature that notifies you of a message.  It's all useless with this app!  Oh and I'm still not downloading messenger.  You fill up our phones with to much as it is.
Ok so i updated and when it finish i went on it and it glitch to home screen like wtf plzzz fix it
good loved it
K kak
I like this app works great but i hate. That they make you download messenger. A whole separate app just. To view. Your fb messages. Stupid idea.
Mangain kumar chaudhary

The globe button should take me to notifications instead of last viewed post.
Can't turns off autoplay, can't adjust news feed to see most recent and takes up a ton of memory. Only use it because it is even worse in my browser.
can't load images on wifi. Only  on data connection it shows d  images. Plz fix it 
Qmobile a36
This new update has bugs that need to be fixed. I can't scroll through anyone's profile pictures and I can't go through my own profile pictures. A fix would be great.
Would be nice if we could have a personal setting to not receive messages.
Greatttttttttt

I updated it and now.it wont let me get into the app
When I logout it takes so long its very slow please fix

Keeping me from things I should be doing since 2008. Thanks

Good application concept but some Gujarati news not seen in application. Improve them and speed and new design require also need speed improvement.
Nice
Can be more fast
G9ooooooood

Could have updated and made it much more slower now this makes this update suck!

Plzzz  fix  it  and   this update  is  so bad   ....
The app uses to much memory and it's increasing size every update!
Good Facebook
now it keeps force closing. It won't even open after this previous update......
This app keeps force closing and I don't know why. Please try and sort this problem.
Very nice aap

Its so very log log
But it always freezes

and better! Since a few updates, the app starts and works significantly faster. Keep up the good work! :-)
Fix the bugs
Its simplest to upload photos .....
Takes for ever to log out, a.d makes my phone freeze up,one would tbink facebook techies could work out a few bugs
I like it
Ok
Takes up entirely too much space.
Terrible upgrades, creating more of a nuisance than assistance.
The permissions required invade our privacy. They don't need access to my Google config, they want it so that it makes it easier to mine our information.  I'm glad that I don't have anything personal in this phone
Its a must
Sucks
Pravin pandian
Help...........update is not working properly plzz send a link of old version
Video player always crash.
I can't stand Facebook, people are always sending me game requests and I always get emails its so annoying
I m nt interestd to add just.for chat. It would take memory n net more n also FB hangs almost...huh
NICE
We all are forced to download that app... I disagree...!!!
Angel n 1951
Too much data. Too heavy...
After my Facebook app recently updated, I am unable to open it as it crashes after showing me the Facebook logo. It attempts to open saying "Setting up Facebook" then "Just a moment" to which it crashes soon afterwards.
Make it much more smoother.. i will rate 5 stars.. please...

Good

Nicely done

Nice
Very nice it so good its so wawwww... ..    ......try it duf
Its a stupid app firstly it takes a lot of tym to openn den it hangs... m haappy tht fb has upgraded bt d app its worst
Aaargh when they gonna learn that everyone wants Most Recent news feed first??!! Why the hell would I want Top Stories news feed and see posts from 4 days ago?
All it does is say "starting up facebook" and never loads  to the point where I can sign in.
stay good
Had to do as title says after updates because was taking forever to open app and to refresh.  Also remember to go into menu (top right)  down  to app settings to turn off video auto play! This will save battery life!  Good luck hope this helps.
Pls add user friendly option to delete people frm list
Best back

Its always not responding to my phone. And it always says force close. But, Istill like the updates. I hope this would be fix. Thank u.
Its facebook so...
Unable to change custom 'privacy setting' for posts
How is Facebook this terrible now? I log on and 2 seconds later Facebook closes. I cant even see my notifications anymore.  For a billion dollar company, it doesn't show.
I don't appreciate you having an update where your own crummy browser is used automatically without asking me for a choice. I end up spending time going to the option to Open With my own default browser. Please ask people for a preference choice instead of shoving your ideas on everyone. Also I don't like having to go all the way to my profile just to view my most recent feed. I feel I should be able to decide which feed I want to see. Instead of it defaulty being your opinion of top stories.
Facebook application is getting laggy and slow on loading my Xperia Z. Why whenever I play video it says "Sorry an unexpected error occurred while playing the video" it happens everytime now and then. Always hang and stopped responding everytime I browse pictures.. Please fix!!
I lilililike it...
Bad update what you do facebook admin what are you doing I mean something do clear the problems sucker update
Its good compared to other social apps.
No default setting for most recent, only many tap, swipe. It is bullshit. Go back older version in facebook app.
Great for family
I am really getting fed up how this app keeps crashing on my phone!! You have lost a lot of respect from your users because of your lack to try and truly fix the app! Please fix the app!!
Coooool

This app is horrible
It keeps shuting done when i go from one page to another. Removed and reinstalled atleast 3. Using samsung 10.1 tablet with lastest update. Removed it and will not be putting it back until they fix it.
Good app
Works slow n sticks my phone
After the last update my phone is so slow... Facebook app load for about 2 minutes.. Please solve it
why cant we use messages
I've been reunited with a couple of very good friends from school that I completely lost touch with. What true gift, and a complete blessing.
I am use this software & i am felling good...
Nice    Nice
I love Facebook
Why do you continue to change the app. Just when you get used to it you change again. I predict Facebook to disappear just like Myspace did. Mostly cause they get greedy and forget from which it was born.
Its greatest
Can't download update. Just says "can't download due to an error". Have tried more than 5 or 6 times. About to un-install >:(
I do not like it at all
I love it.
Good
Really bad.....
It is much worst then earlier

Wonderfull.....
Good
Cant see the pics uploaded by various pages on my timeline!
Its now OK because of its better speed!!!
Not open after the update!
Now you want me to load Messenger along with this one? Seems this one should should then get smaller but that isn't the case.
Man I this ishh. .
Great, although sharing "with someone" or tagging article or links automatically is no longer working and makes me repeat the same action  (Photo tags are okay).  Otherwise, fine as long as nobody bothers me.
Its a good app for communicating with friends
Loading to slow
lve ths apps
Nice
The best part is remove tag by own..
The Facebook app is awesome. It took me a while to sign in because I forgot password at first.
Ok
Like it ok

Continuous updates with no improvements to speed or stability. Too many issues to mention and complaining doesn't help....hate the app!!!!!!!!
Shammi
Hate the way when a new update comes along and it doesn't work there is no option to go back to the previous version. Since the recent update it won't open at all :-(
Well invented
Messenger is like hell , it could be the best aap  with log out option
When I have time on my hands facebook is where I go
Yeah!n
Getting worst after update
Good app
Its very good informative media

Crap!! Very Slow, No good features and now it says facebook authentication failed when logging in. This app needs major work. 2014 October:Yep this app and Facebook are still crap. The feeds are terrible, consistently loads feeds you've already seen while scrolling through and when you click to read something and then return to the feed it starts over again. Total crap. Google+ is far superior. Google is doing an amazing job.
its awesome!!!!
Throttle it back. What update EVERY week?
It's a great app but I wish you could block all the drama and block out the cuss words sometimes.
Good
Update your app to let me unread a mesage!!!!!
A recent update has caused the app to complain that every link I follow through the app is bad. They aren't! How do I turn this off?
App won't let u edit comments or posts,  also puts all your pictures in the gallery together and out of order,  making it extremely time consuming to choose and upload.
Installing app  faster fb
Rinku kumar
Perfect
last update says for improvement on reliability and speed... but it got worst taking too long to open sometimes crashes
Super
Nice
Your app is f****g boring av domnloaded it more than once and all it does is nothing..wenevers i touch it it disappears...

The news feed stops updating  unless I  restart my phone. I don't think  I  should have  to shut down and completely restart my phone every time  I  wish to use a app. Facebook  is the only app that refuses to work.
I can't post any pictures. This sucks.
Too much spac :(
Unnecessarily forcing its users to install separate app for messenger
I m a sempel boy
This used to be a great app, it sucks up my battery from full to nothing in less than an hour, plus a messenger app? Really?  Facebook doesn't need it. Had to eliminate for the sake of my battery life span.
Facebook
I always receive insufficient memory whenever I'm downloading how
Very nice
Whenever I go to active friends messenger tab, Facebook completely exits and shuts down.
Its use full
Too much update, always requesting for update
Good app
Ahssmh
After the last update, the app is not opening in my phone..just 'setting up fb, just a moment..' and then nothing..
Update update update, every time updates
Good aap
I like this facebook app it nice but it is very slow...
"Trouble loading news feed" message over and over and over and over
Unable to use app when updated on Sony Xperia. Really p'd off!!

simply the best...
It sometimes takes forever to load anything
Reliable so far
You need to let me choose which newsfeeds I want to see, I have just about 200 friends and I only get post from about 12 people, just because I don't like or comment on them doesn't mean I don't want to see them,  you are not listening as I have said this before
Opening app takes long time except this everything is fine
Works well but I need to adjust the font size but the system settings make no difference.
Like
good app...
Bhatti welder
Don't like all the memory it takes up. Also, should have left the. messenger on there instead of making people use app.  Anytime I upload a picture it is blurry.  Not blurry when I take the picture. Would like to see recent posts when I sign in
Now the app doesn't open at all. I'm uninstalling  it because its not worth all the space it's taking up
The title says it all, even though it opens on this GS4 on 4.4.2, I have another phone running on 4.2.2 in which it "tabs down" 2 seconds after you press the icon.
What an excellent app
This thing has more privacy invasive permissions than any other app I've seen. I don't need you listening to my microphone 24 hours a day just so I can check my news feed. I recommend "tinfoil" for a Facebook app if you feel the same about the permissions.
Cool app to be in touch with your friends ,but its updates occupies more space

Shuts down too much, still!!
Having issues with it shutting down after the first min of logging in.
Since an update 2 weeks ago FB on my tablet will just randomly shut down. And don't even try to think about posting anything or looking at your notifications.  Uninstalled it on my tablet and won't be reinstalling it anytime soon.
Love the way of talking
In the past 2 days, everytime i open facebook on android it always starts with "SETTING UP FACEBOOK". Can anyone help me?
Nice :))
Everything is taking way too long to load
Nice
It won't show how long ago people have been on FB.
On my Samsung Galaxy it keeps shutting down. Same with the Razor Maxx! Grrr
Facebook
Please stop doing updates with a lot of space,Facebook keeps sucking my megabits because it takes a lot of space and the updates suck,I remember that in the last update you could go check how many followers you had but now its hidden and I don't know how to check,please reply to my comment for a higher rating.
OMG I SEE LOTS OF PICS ITS LIKE A DREAM

Everytime I open, it always says setting up facebook, after a minute l it says just a moment, then after that FORCE CLOSE!! I dont like the new update of it! please fix this immediately.  Its annoying! Very Annoying!!
Got a lg and all this app is doing is taking more and more space . Data keeps rising until memory is full . I uninstalled it, tried to reinstall it , and it won't download.
Logg
Yall need to stop this app is the bomb if u guys complain its prabably because u DONT KNOW HOW TO USE IT 
Fix the news feed
Iyae
Goooooooooooooooopoooopooood

Apppppppppppp
This app sucks!! Force closes a lot, unable to uninstall the update..
Whenever I scroll through my news feed, and I come across a video that someone has shared, the video will crash the entire app!! Please, For f*ck sake, fix this app!! You are going to lose a lot of users if you don't start listening to them.
Again, I'm one of those that this app won't open. I've got android 4.2.9. App says configuring, then closes down... FB, ever heard of the idea, "Less is more"? Stop adding crap every frigging day and people will stop complaining!

Excellent
Awsme
Lastest update  - awful keeps closing. Can not do or get to anything. FIX IT  This is NOT an older version.
Very slow

Oh wow! !! I'm in 2014 lol

Always update nd so sooo slow i hate it.. can u please fix this
Before updating my facebook app, all was fine. The app keeps bringing me back to this page. It will not open on my phone. Very frustrating. Please fix this.
Hard for me to really understand how to get into my account without having to start another one.
Reegan
Finally the app is amazing
Amazing
Shouldn't force users to download messenger. Now facebook and messenger consume so much ram that i had to restart my phone
The update did not fix my previous problem. It made it worse! I can only open my FB for ten seconds the closes! Please fix because it makes me ANGRY. (0 stars if I could)
its lovly
I love Facebook
Nice ;)
terbaik :p
But it is taking so much of time to install
Am I the only person having issues watching clips on Facebook with this app? I have no problems if I log unto the web version of Facebook on this same phone. I'm using the Sony experia z

Get rid of this annoying "people you may know" from news feed!!!!
Fun easy fast
App crashes EVERYTIME i try to use it... have made sure my tablet is up to date and always update to the newest version of Facebook in hopes it will work and it never does... Forced to use Facebook through the browser!!!
Had to uninstall app, my phone was lagging & shutting down, consistently... Fix please!
Every time I use the app I get to see about 6 posts then my whole phone locks up and I have to restart my device.
Fb is our life

Wonderful beautiful. Excellent
Every time I scroll through my feed, it will freeze up and then a pop up will show that says "Facebook is not responding, would you like to close it?" It is really annoying.
This app deservs 0 stars..day by day this is taking his level low nd low..
So with the new update the app worked perfectly for like two days. Now it gets stuck on a loading screen and the app freezes if I try to exit, and I force close and try again, it starts loading and it happens all over again. This app is the definition of insanity. Getting an alternative app, tired of this BS. Nexus 4.  P.S. THIS IS THE ONLY APP THAT MALFUNCTIONS ON MY PHONE SO I KNOW FOR A FACT MY PHONE IS NOT THE PROBLEM.
make some cool widget
Last noght im update facebook.now its evey slow

No problems ! Vry Good app ! Keep the gud wrk up !

Nice app
O yes
Why force people to download your messenger? I won't be chatting here!
Updated and when I log out it just keeps saying logging out forever. So I have to restart my phone to make it actually log out. It sucks please fix this! I also can't watch videos either since I updated like 6 times ago. Ugghh very aggravated!!

I love facebook
Used to work great, now will not even open on my phone. I tried everything. I had to uninstall. :(
Your update had an express ticket straight south! Whenever I launch the app, it'd say "Setting up Facebook" or "Just a Moment." Then, it would load until forever until it crash! This is one helluva inconvenient. DSAT!
What a book
Best but don't space many time downloding problm
Daily Devotion
New update run smoothly, keep it up
I've used the app for a number of years. It has become a colossal issue in the name of what's private and the life of a phone. There's no excuse for the terrible and inefficient programming that has added up over time and brings in questionable additions. In addition to eating the battery of every device on the market and generating fake issues, having the keys to the town at install with android devices, and updating unexpectedly frequently, it's clearly time to pass on this poor app.
Love it u cn follow ppl whn u oflne
It keeps crashing. And every time I get on it it's gotta load.
Can't sort news feed by most recent. New UI is LESS user friendly. Want old version back.
This app is horrible. It updates constantly and it keeps trying to force me to get the messanger app
Lovely
love it

I just LOVED it...

Very much  liked it

Its so bad i cant use it at all. I have given up on it and just use the mobile site. That works much better. I only keep it installed so i can share to facebook off of my camera and to sync other apps
I cant scroll through photos anymore -_-
Log out error
This app is always auto loging out, please fix it
Cant Even Download The Shit
Loving...
Very  very best app
I Downloaded The App But The App Isn't On My Phone & When I Go To My Settings & Manage Applications It Says Its On My Phone But Its Not
Won't load anything, won't refresh either. It eats battery like pacman eats power pellets.
Lovely
Too slow to load! Fix it plz.
Hey hey my Facebook friends
Every time I click a link to check out an article someone posted, it now crashes. The browser app works fine outside of Facebook. Not in. They're is always something that crashes when you change the app.
Birthday notifications don't always work. I get them on some days, some days I don't.
Nafees mobile
I am using a 10.1 samsung galaxy tab 3, and it crashes most of the time... I had to use a browser to get to facebook... It also happens on my iphone...
It is wow
I love this application. You must get it.
I really liked it! But the next update should be.... A ZERO STARS BUTTON! IF SUCKS! Update, Update, Update, Crash, Update......
i hate this app!
App is way too big slim it down!!!!!!!!!!
Crashes every 5 mins.
videos will not play and always buffering.i'm using 4G LTE broadband and still the same problem.
Taking all time
I updated my tablet and now I get can't do anything. I try to view a post, get booted off. Try to share, get booted off.  Try to like, or comment,  get booted off. Can't even scroll.  I HATE THE UPDATE!
Updated to 4.4.2. Whenever you try and click on an article, post or comment there's an 50% chance the app crashes. If I'm browsing through the feed for ten minutes there's a good chance I've had to restart it 2 or 3 times already. Please fix!!!!!!!!!
Memory space. This one's a killer. Also privacy issues. Facebook, you really don't require  all that access to our devices do you? Heard a dirty rumour you've been selling this info for profit to marketing companies. Well for now my hands are tied if I wish to correspond with loved ones on a somewhat decent social networking site. Until the next best thing comes along...
Mace moos
Horrible... Facebook your just getting worse and worse every time you get a new update... Go back to the old version of facebook
Why
New
Anyone knows how yo disable the resident link opening feature.. I hate it
Many update
Everything works fine for me i love the app.
Why I  cannot log out...?
I love this
Most of the time it needs 20-30secs to start and after the last upgrade, it won't launch at all... Quite irritating!
Apple devices are great, but it seems every time Facebook gets updated, it tends to look more like it is on an Apple device. Some people also use Androids.
Memory usages on ram is to high when app isn't open
The best
Too much force close.
Needs update every week

Too slow then force close..fix it...
Bring back the chat section
:-) its great
Gone backwards. Viewing 'Most recent' newsfeed should not be a hassle. Let us choose the default order. And not as screen overlayed on the order you want us to use. And now I can't see the notifications tab from the 'Most recent' screen.

Every time,you update, it occupies vast memory. Do you think it is necessary.?

I loved facebook it was awesome but now you are doing much and much updates for simple reasons and taking much space from my phone any way that is not the problem but the problem is now after all your updates I can't upload news feed I can't see my message or notifications and that is the same problem in messenger I can't see my messages and I think that fixing  this problem is better then 100 on useless updates
obviously thus ia the best app fam
Good
But no top comments show so
After last update it's too slow why do you need to put many update you destroying  you're FB app please fix it
love it

For god's sake Mr Zuckerberg, how can it be so difficult!? Everybody wants most recent to be the default feed so why aren't you listening?
Awesome
There's no way it works properly on my tablet. Uninstalled it.

I updated my app and all it did was slow it down, and it crashes like every 1 min fix it or I'M uninstall
Nothing will Load! It takes for ever if at all!
Blah blah blah blah blah is how i feel

Much better in new phone. Edit: Several months and many updates later it is slower. So a star knocked off.
Browser
So I thought by updating you add useful features not take them away? On the last update you configured it to where you didn't have to leave the app to view an external url link... And this update that is gone.  Please bring it back so I don't have to keep opening a Web browser to view something. IPhone does it so let DROID too!

Please update app. Some people don't want messenger. Please update app by taking the message notification off the app. Tired of seeing the 1 on Facebook icon. About to uninstall I've complained and no response. Thanks for giving me the finger.
Needs to be improved like whatsup's file transmission
Dear Facebook, Y U NO WORK? Seriously dough since the last update the app just crashes every time I open it

Excellent app guys
I recommend this application for people of good taste, it provide better links.
Gee still no fix for the Samsung galaxy tab 3 10.1
Never lags and gets to keep in touch with old friends
I don't want to use messanger for chat and call
This app. Can use your mic camera and gps at ANY time and WITHOUT your confirmation. Starts streaming videos using your internet connection more without your confirmation. Privacy stettings are very moderate.
Better
This good option so good
facebook hebat
Good evening. Since the latest update the app will take a long time to open. It will always say "one moment please" when I open the app, then it will load and load until the message "Facebook is not responding. Do you want to close the app? Wait/Report/Okay".
The spying, the freezing, the lagging etc etc. too much space,too many problems equals lack of respect for customers. Everyone at work says the same and we so use various phones. The money they make leaves no excuse for such a dismal app. I'm done.
Very good
Good Time Pass
Off course the best social networks
I happy to this app I'm very enjoying..
Getting bore of facebook's interface. Need simple and attractive interface so that we can enjoy facebooking
Enjoyed
It does not log out ,it takes lots of RAM,poor support options inside the FB application.I have Sony Xperia L android 4.2 when i try to log out it acts like it is loging out but it does not.I have to reopen FB and log out again.
I was just on the app and came across a video that someone shared. When I went to comment, it said that we can now comment with a sticker and did. Went to comment on something else and the option to comment with a sticker wasn't there... what's up with that?? It's either we can comment with stickers or not. Please fix it!
love it
o
Fine and convenient
All I see are bad reviews and now Facebook is doing the same thing as the messenger in permissions to take audio and video without our knowledge.  Send messages and emails without our knowledge. ..... why????
Better
As slow as a freaking turtle with weights on it.

New facebook app was sluggish and often fail even opened.  Applications seem even slower response in the smartphone Nexus 4 kitkat android 4.4.4 with ART runtime.  The latest update makes the application often fails loading. Had to repeat several times, then be opened. Hopefully soon repaired the better as before.
I can't use the app for more than 10 seconds before it just closes and I'm staring at my home screen. PLEASE fix this! - Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1

Worst update.
news and the stat , pics , and the upper tool bar , the page rolls up & down like a slot machine . And then it kicks me off b4 closing ,  lag  lag lag ... Update... and  my smart  phone  is  specially slow . . Short bus 4 sure .
Takes too much space ... literally had to uninstall it then install again.
Application crashes on playing videos.
What a app
I don't like complaining... but the newest update that I received won't allow me to "like" anything or comment on anything either. Please fix quickly. I have a Droid Razr running jellybean. Ok, New update! Changed phones. Now have HTC 1 M8, now my friends list won't load! Can you guys please work out all these bugs. Tired of uninstalling, and reinstalling to try to fix.
Constantly freezing up, messanger has too many intrusive app permissions, and the video constantly freeze off wifi and that is using full 4g data signal.
Brilliant
Super nice
Nice app

Extremely annoying, when you want to write a status, comment on a status, like a status the app crashes. When you try and search people/pages/groups either crashes before searches or when you click on it crashes. No matter how many times they keep updating the app it always seems to come back a lot worse!
This wab is very nice
I love it

Stop making me download fb messanger! I DON'T WANT IT! Until then I'll give 5 stars!

AWESOMENESS good way of  get hold of friends
Really fast
The best social media
For a dinosaur, my experience has been quite positive.  I may have made the claim above, but three weeks on I find linking to Facebook on my phone slow. Then fb's response to links is frustratingly slow, if it reach conclusion.
Like
Everytime i exit the app it won't open again. Either it crashes or "just wait one moment" will take forever to load. Please fix this.
I like or love the fifth star i am a star
Nice App

Woow.nice

Single
Can't play video on my Android phone. Fb  forcefully make load massanger...
Nice
There's a problem opening in this app :(
Its too esy to use,to chat wid frinds,to upload nd many more things.......nd after all i wanna say dat i loved dis app......
It is fabulous
Mybook
Slow as hell. Freezes and crashes for no reason.  Forced to download Messenger to retain functionality. Installed size is over 100 MB! Updates slow it down even more. Write things for older devices - not everyone can afford the latest phones!

Hehehe
Working fine before update...doesn't work now...extremely frustrating...won't open the first 2 attempts and when it finaly does it takes forever. Once it opens can't see new feeds or any photos....i would rate 0 if I could
Perfect
I prefer to check face book through my web browser; too many permissions, and a waste of phone resources, if I could delete it I would.  After they removed messages, they didn't even make the effort to remove message notifications; lazy or clumsy, your pick...
Desperately needs move to SD CARD.
Taking forever to download
Super laggy on my LG G3
Thanks
Nice
:D
Really good
It isa good app
When i signout n want to again sign in there error been acour Bakwas app
the facebook app has some network issues.
Old vrsion
I looked through some of the reviews and noticed that most people don't like this app. My salutation was to uninstall it and go through my web browser. Sorry
Sometimes it wont open, maybe it is because of the bugs
I Like it so Much <3
Its nice. But it takes a lot space. And I don't know why a lot of data is created by it? Ok even its created why Isnt it getting stored in SD card ?

The app is full of crap.it takes alot of space hence the phone is ever on low space.
It's Saturday and the stupid app has stuff from Wednesday. Can't choose what news feed i want, I can only choose who i want to see on my news feed. I'm done using this crappy app. Freezes, forces closed, drains battery.
This app is ****
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
Its too slow to many pop outs pls fix
Awesome and fantastic

Superb
Ok
Go nawaz Go
After the new update the application keeps on crashing.... and the news feed is disgusting
So crap
Mudah di muat naik pd peranti rendah mcm saya
Having this kind of app in your phone is really important, the information that you might need will feed to your account instantly..
Downloading a second app is a huge waste of time. Sort it out! And each update is worse than the previous. Not impressed at all.
This app Sucks
Facebook makes my life cooler than before,.
The most popular app in the world still has problems...Confused...I've been using the regular browsers for logging into Facebook...Not the best way to go. Not on phones or tablets for my opition...So i waited thinking it will be fixed by now...NOT...Social media not going to be the death of me, but when your family lives in one state and you live in another, its kind of important..I never write comments but hear my cry...LOL I can play doddle jump but can't go on Facebook...No Disrespect
Can't find anyone that I know for sure is on facebook.... Plus the boring constant updating, plus the non intuitive android app... Too bad there is no use uninstalling it. This selfconsumed app is keeping us hostages, not having the ear to hear consumers complains. Hate you guys!
pls help me.. cant install it to my asus mobile.. its say "error duplicate app" i want facebook latest version on asus mobile pls..
Not in the mood to describe but makes life better
A horrible app with only useless photos. Anyway I really hate it.
Jo
Love it
Not good not open not logout
MANIKUMAR
Still any good points of this app are wiped up by the huge array of negative improvements.  Constant connection issues, particularly roaming, appalling irrelevant news feed, limited function, INEXCUSABLE POOR MOBILE VIDEO UPLOAD QUALITY!!  This is not free faceache make billions off our backs from our content, with this in mind the parasitic company could at least provide something that works properly & consistently.  As for the separate messenger app, WTF, seriously?!
Things that I've spotted. 1. No Top comments Still. 2. When changing the profile picture, the quality is not as it is on the original upload, it depends on your phone you're using and it do suck if you are using a low end phone.
Arain
Gela
Tnx
Nice
Good app
I like it ^_^
I've waited like an our and. It doesn't want to log me in. The iOS version is much better!!!
Lots of little things that could be fixed. Like being able to see your videos album. And being able to pick where the messages go that are from people that you're not friends with and being able to actually get to your other folder from the mobile app. Would be nice...
Very very love it
Cannot be install
This application is sucking my time was unable to migrate to facebook, have to get to face through my mail
Aweful
Nice

Zaharaahmad52
Late
Must still free
Waw
It brings more civilization
After the update the app takes too long to start! Everytime I start it says "Setting up Facebook..." then "One moment please..." everytime! I'd understand if it was only once but seriously?? It kills time. AND WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO MAKE A SEPARATE APP FOR MESSAGING?? Seriously guys, our phones can't take too much memory since it's bad for our RAM. FIX IT.
Got a notification that I could comment with a sticker! But I am unable to do so! Disappointed!!
owesome
i install
Too enough space
Suck
facebook is an mirror of social
Help to connect people
Nice app
Not able to copy d posts like in d Web version
Make it a permanent option that we can make our News Feed recent.Also,, Whenever I update my profile. I have to reset my password!!!!  FIX THIS!!!!
Good
i love fb
It's use too much data. And my older phone can't take it cause it's huge space ..
Crash problem still exist

Aaaallllaaaaaaaaaaaa
Awesome
it's very ok
You ppl should consider even smaller phones which doesn't have enough ram to run all apps ... I'm trying to install only very few apps so that my phone doesn't hang... Now because of this new update I'm forced to install fb messenger... Because of this one more extra app ...! Please do consider these points when giving an update
Good app but i don't want to download the messenger. Get rid of it and let me send messages from this app.
Updates are in a random order, how crap is that. They should be down in the order they are posted. Come on Facebook, fix it. Don't like seeing 1 update 1hr old then the one underneath 20 mins old and so on. Not noticed this on google+. Also just recently the scrolling down friends lists sticks randomly resulting in restarting what I was doing. Not good FB.
Works great after all those updates.
so great
good
great app

Excellent Tops**
Unable to find most recent
Sucks
Love it
I have to uninstall Facebook in order to update everything else...which is not much. Memory hog like never before.
Too big, forcing an even worse app (messenger) on its hapless users, freezing, destroying privacy and selling our info and usage stats to ad agencies... oh, and constant space-hogging updates.. where do I sign up for that, please?
uses too much ram.. 104mb to be exact. . .
worst written app ever
I can't find The save option after update
Md.Almasb hossain
Awesome app dear friends I love it

Better than going n searching in goolge n then fb
VERY good
Getting better
Not up to scratch
Very good
The app kept on crashing following the major Samsung Tab 3 software update over two weeks agi and has been a dog ever since. I have resorted to using FB through Chrome and I hate that just as much.
Nikki
Nice

Its really awesome and intersting 2 i jst luvvv itt
So stupid
Jesus , is keeping saying setting up facebook and it never ends , plz FIX IT
You heard me
Too many updates n large memory occupying app. Drains battery fast.
Ok
Too big and crashes with updates. Just installed the update and I am getting a white screen and my phone is hanging even with quad core.
Good app that make I enjoy my social life full time
It's all about the bling
I love it
fb the best cocial network
I would express my expression in this app. Such a social site which help me stay connected with my friend and relatives.
Auto font detection & enabling need to be done.
Wasn't compatible with my sony
Nice
Just after the latest update, my phone is getting heated up very quickly and drainage of battery has become faster!
:)
Shite at times click on it and it cimes straight oofff
After several updates it still randomly shuts down while trying to use it. You would think some one could get this right.
Connection
To slow and to large for updated,hated it.give back the oldest facebook
I can't open this app.. I think this app has many viruses and bugs.. Fix now.. Always lagging.. 
Like

Why does it need over 100mb after logging in?
It always says my memory was full
Like it because i can talk to friends
Gerhart
Ever since the last update i cannot run facebook on my ph it just wont open...help please someone.might need to roll it back somhow.
Too many updates and most of the times it doesn't work as it should. In addition to this, too much memory space for this app. Fix it and stop making nonsense updates. You have already forced me to install the messenger app otherwise I couldn't read my private message.
I hate it..it so very f***ing
Facebook updates so often and takes up more space each.time. it also will not connect any of my games so i can get my rewards. Started this after the first time i updates.
Just. ..
More reliability and speed ???? The latest update has broken FB and makes my phone and tablet freeze and become unresponsive
Nice one!!
Huh after the latest update its just not working 
It's fun to use this apps
Ok Joke's over. Ha ha. 1st, messenger crashed when accessed and everytime it restarted, & making other apps crash. Now it works, and the facebook app crashes when I try to share 'anything'. Click share wait click post, facebook app crashes. Same happens often clicking on videos, weblinks, going to friend's wall pages, and even when I try to go to my own wall page. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Didn't help. The fact that it worked fine on my Galaxy Tab3 for over a year, right up until last month, maybe longer. In the app reviews, I saw over 10 users who have the same problem and at least half are also using a Galaxy Tab 3 too. I've been using my laptop instead, because of the app's instability on android 4.4 (Kitkat). So, like I said.. Ok, joke's over. Right?
Crashing
I can not write events on my dp n cover i mean no any option for it direct setting of dp n cover
Awesom games

Very help ful s.w
Make it easy
With the new update, you have removed the notification bar, that usually stayed in place when I clicked on a notification.With that I didn't have to go back,click a new notification and repeat. Also after going back and returning to my newsfeed it goes back to the very top and refreshes so I lose the place I was in -____- Please just put that part back to the way it was. Because it was more convenient that way and Im sure that's what you hope your app to be.A faster and more convenient way of using Facebook
its exelent
Need da option to save to sd card.. takes wayyyyyy to much memory
loved it
Excellent
Worst App ever.. doesn't even load pictures at all. Fix this sh*t.

Lalalalalalala
Can't You all just decrease the space for this app.. For people having low end phones.. Where the problem of space comes up.. This app is not at all friendly.. Installing it.. Taking 20mb of my memory.. After Log In.. Another 30-40 mb is taken and then.. After taking all sorts of caches and datas.. It almost ends up with eating 80-90 mb of the memory( Thats about 40% of my memory).. My humble to plz reduce the space to a bigger extent.. _/\_
awsm..

It seems that since I wrote my last review facebook have actually listened to the complaints about there being too many permissions required! Miracle! If the app actually functions better I'll give it another star...
Everytime l go to comment the application closes rubbish.....
I unpacked the apk and found hundreds of useless resources. Takes a lot of space and battery

Jghajnf

Nice
Takes up to much memory
Since updated new version I can't receive message from other if I didn't have the messenger. Suck it
Is there any way to ease up on the random refreshing? I'll be far down my feed, reading something, & it'll refresh and I lose my place. It's completely random, too...
Too many update and morons removed messenger like I can't use my browser really messenger was a battery killer Facebook was great now corp fools
nice app
Good app for biz
I like face book
It is better than the older version.
Yuuppp
Waha
Gooood

Sering Crash di update terbaru
Ok, not great!
Wow
5*+
I'll decide what way I view my news feed.

I think it is not needed.
Success at any cost

I love faceebook
All so perfect
Can't even load the App, it stopped everytime I tried to load it. All what I see is "Just a moment please" The update is not good. It really suck. I will rate it 5 stars when solved.
It freezes constantly or shuts down at random
Always crashes, then Ill uninstall and reinstall it. It is just loading and it took hours and still loading. FIX THIS!
Never wants to work
Thanks

Good to deal with but it uninstalls when I reboot my phone. I'm using Gionee p4
It just gets sometimes slow. But otherwise its a cool app
Facebook developers team is using "dirty" hacks to get more resources from your phone causing other apps to lag. Not to mention its a privacy sucker
I'm using a oneplus one and app was working fine till today which it received an update. It won't load. just said setting up. Please fix
Won't let me reinstall the app because its way to much space. That is just crap! Buh bye Facebook!!!!!!
081637236
Good very cool apps
The thing is I can't wait ages to post pictures. This app makes it quick. But no extra facility. You better have an SD card if you want fast posting.
Lg g3 all phone works fine but facebook freezes and handset has to be restarted
Its gud
Pdhl ga terlalu bnyk perbaikan untuk updatenya ... Ngabisin memory
There is no settings for latest status updates the top stories thing is dumb. This app keeps getting worse.  The main page is all top stories so to see the news feed chronologically I have to go into settings now I can't see my notifications while in there.... terrible design and functionality
Nice
To slow
Winer
Good

For the past week or so...since update, I guess, have had terrible problems getting the app to open...mostly just get blank grey screen. Takes an age to get on it.. and this morning I can't access the app at all!! Rubbish!
I am very happy for using Facebook my all school collage friends contact with mi
My mains

What a wonderfull experience to use facebook
I have always downloading & updating & installing problems & login & logout problems & processing very slow please help me
Hi apno ke sath rahne ka assan jariya
Not open
Every update is crap. It gets worse as it gets update. I had given it 4 stars before but im giving it 1. It closes without warning, not even a force close. The update is really bad. Can't wait for Ello
Ok
My phone has gone crazy after the latest update.  Freezing, hanging and restarting constantly.. Fix it please!  :-(
awesome
Can you make the interface as the same as the ios version??
I have a galaxy 3 tablet and Facebook is always closing every time I do anything but scroll up or down!!!!!!!! I'm about to cancel my account if something doesn't change soon.
After the latest update I can only see events I'm invited to. Where is the option to see events happening near me?
Loads of updates yet no visible improvement
Cse

Love it over don't love but me I'll live????
Excellent social site

Why can't I log in even if I'm already using our internet connection at home on my mobile phone? Your updates really are innapropriate.
Love the latest update
Every time i scroll through the news feed my phone freezes when videos come up!
All right

worst ever fb app
Pics and videos wont load..probably i should give 0 star for this
Ramji
5 star

Fine...
Cooooooll

Nice
It's Gud 2 use .... Bt sum tym it won't work properly .... dat tym feel like 2 delete fb app .... wen v update it nt working 4 half an hour ....
Masala?   -love you too? .love you?
Good
Well I like Facebook but you have to use Facebook messenger to talk to people ughhhhhh! THIS IS ANNOYING
The new update is... horrible. Sorry for the use of word but it doesn't let me open my facebook anymore. Please fix this.
I like Facebook, and this app does a great job at keeping you connected. The only problem is that if you leave the app by following a link inside the app, you will have to restart back at the top of your news feed. Other than that, this app works great!
Too slow
It's my favorite
Super
Awesome app!!!!!!
After this update my phone, game and others app open very slowww. I'm not sure what's it do in my phone background but I confident it's only effect from this update sure. Fix it nowww
Literally would have given this app a 0 if I could. Crashes every 5 seconds. Not exaggerating.  Can't read messages without the terrible messaging download. Downloaded that and that crashes so much I can't read my messages. Get your crap together facebook!!!!
Once you sync contacts it's impossible to remove them from your phone
After the update,always crashing.. What happen???
The app isn't working properly.
Azadking
Crashing all the time
Good job
Please include "Get Notifications" when you like a Page. This used to be available on the FB app but no longer. Once I like a Page from the app, I still need to select Get Notifications from the computer. I do love the Facebook app. (HTC One) Thx
Cool way to keep up with whole family and a lot of friends.
Facebook helps me to stay in touch with family and friends that I wouldn`t otherwise be able to.
Facebook
Using the correct way gives you the opportunity to gain many benefits .miss use of this application gives you the opportunity to gain access to the worst disadvantages of your life. So its best to make sure you are not miss using this application.
Well Facebook suck now its all old stuff and I really hate it
Can't read or send messages from app. Will not install another app for messages.
Will not stay open on my tablet! Fix it! Would give 0 if I could!
best
Cool
Adulthood
Please Dont Update Facebook Every Weak Just Update it once a month so my phone doesnt get Full i will give 5 stars If u did
Why do I have this app.. The Web browser version is better.
Nice
I cant imagine  my lyf wthout t
Kaju  nager
Love this
I have this app for a while now. The last update made this app load forever I can't see my latest news feeds and notifications. I am greatly disappointed..
As it connects the relatives and decrease the distances
Tantas actualizaciones para que siga ocupando el mismo espacio de siempre, la misma ram de siempre y siga con la pprquera de no poder chatear.... Una estrella es demasiado para este programa
It is good
What the hell happen to my fb app? I uninstalled and re-installed it for many times already, but it kept on Setting Facebook and Just a moment etc. It never went beyond there. Tsk tsk!
Takes too much space and updates.
To many updates!!
Not bad
Love it
Why is it taking so much space and whenever I scroll down when opened a page it force closes
This stupid app takes to long to download can u do something about this! !!
Takes to much memory and its slow
Love being able to keep up with my friends :)
No other app is worst as this...
Love it was coming from you going with me to come up there for
Wow.
less time..
it's fb what can u say!
It is so lovely
Great Social Media
Talk to the world !!

;)
He's totally on board with Obama for Amnesty that he fires Americans and then says he needs positions filled. However, he seems to want immigrant employees now, instead of the American ones he had let go. It just isn't right, in wanting to give Americans less of a chance...that's called discrimination
Good
Very good
suka banget
I have expressed not to show the year of my birthday. It says only I can see it, but so can everyone else. Once upon a time it was correct but your updates don't work!
This app.seems to update. At least once in two months
App should allow text to be copied like web browsers
Its great i geuss
Super koo
I like it
Best
Slower and slower.
cool!
Facebook? Super simple, its a no brainer. The product is excellent, it superceeds expectations however its delivery has been far underachieved. The app constantly crashes, messenger is no different and should be optional. With the amount of revinue your loyal users provide and your capitol being based entirely on the customers continued responce and use it would seem fitting that time would dive into solving the issues they deem fitting and delivering a product that not only meets expectations but exceeds them would seem to be an obviouse course of action.
its okay until it crashes -.-
I hate this app 5star
this is a very good apps i like it
Aku suami
People complaining that it has to many updates. Then when they don't have all these updates people complain that is glitchy. You can't have it both ways.
After update it sucks
I Like Dota
Slower then window explorer !! You guys should go back to school...!!
I love it
bad app
I love it's
Cant play video post
It updated automatically just because I had a Wi-Fi connection,  and ever since it is making ALL of my apps on my phone freeze or glitch in some manner..  Fix it,  IMMEDIATELY.
i like this.
I'll be scrolling on the newsfeed and it will shut down my whole phone. Can't use anything
Stop with the updates, it was good how it was. And I liked picking my top stories or most recent. Don't see the option to do that anymore
Its ok
This Is how we communicate dumbasses
I would like to have control of my own feed. I don't want to see posts from 2, 3, or 4 days ago. I want the most recent news first!! Fix it and you got five stars back.
That's was a amazing app downloaded by everyone
It is ok somtime its work slow so fix it diserve better
sangat baik
F***ing awesome
Lags on HTC Desire 616. Would rate higher once fixed.
Updating for taking our PRIVACY every week? Nice.
Very nice apps i love this....sometimes is not responding pls fix it...
Super....... but slow
Because I have friends down their so I'm not bored
Loved it
In one word "Listen" to your users ....
I do not appreciate being bombarded with.Do you know so and so. Please stop!!! Still bombarding with "Do you know "
Still garbage. Please make the most recent a default option!! This is what everyone is asking for. Revert back to version 7 for a normal Facebook experience.
Facebook app has any access to anything on your phone, also I do not eant to install messaging app either and I keep getting added into group chats. What a failure
Messenger is  a waste of more space and isn't as nice as what we ha for messaging previously...
Excellent app
-5 stars... Crashes continually. Used to work. Uninstalled, reinstalled, still crashes. All other tablets and phones work, but not this android tab anymore. Can't comment, share or search. Updates even worse. Froze so bad had to do a hard reboot. App is useless.
Whoohho
It keeps crashing and force closing!!
Its better then older verson
Facebook used to be perfect but now its all screwed up with updates and bugs we didn't need
its heating device htc desire 600 when fb open. please solve it.
What the f*** 30 minutes before the homepage will appear?? Is this canbe called faster and reliable???  My phone is samsung galaxy s4. With a stable and fast internet connection. Please fix this app
After the update images are not loading and it takes more time..... Please fix this... HTC ONE X.
I can't add photos to an event.
Its not even starting after updating stuck at setting up Facebook screen.. I tried clearing data but no luck :(
Everithing in this
I don't need to say something.. Because for me.. It's good..
Jeevamani
Not yet
Its absolutely the best app on my phone 
I CAN'T OPEN MY FACEBOOK APP,Please FIXED IT now??
Me and my wife share the phone. So we share this app. If I log out it exits out of the app not letting me log in. Then go back to the app and pops up saying I need to re-log in then exits out again. Its a crappy circle and makes the app useless to me. Please fix this.
it is very excellent !useful to contact with others .thanks .
It's crap
Its become  very slow after the last update . I have not logged in after the last update
Great
Sameer
It is a good app.. but it keepson hanging my phn..
Everything's fine but then until the last update, I can't open the app. Keeps on crashing instead.
Love it
Nice app
Love it
Very dull
Facebook doesn't want to run trough Wi-Fi   fix it up. Facebook inc. Aaaaah and another thing why in the world it won't take me straight to most recent feeds? Instead it take me to something has already pass up to four hours ago. Too bad.                                And now I can't not even update it it keeps saying insufficient storage available, i am uninstalling  it. So sorry but I am not buying another phone for now.
It will make u log out
oo
Use too much of resource ie battery, CPU and RAM
A
Mindblowing
Lov
Ok

As popular as FB is u would think that they would have a lot more upgrades than they do. News feed is behind 1,2,3. Days sometimes even when the refresh is turned on for every 30 mins. The FB app uses extremely to much data. It tends to be slow at loading data from time to time. Yup, FB is making to much money to be slacking like they are.
Yay
I can't use my stage name as a performer because I'm not a drag queen. Sexist much?
Permanent message
superb
love to use it because it paly or it shows your pic and your profile smoothly
Lags a Lot...... >:(
I liked it very much
Its fast
Owner
Floods my newsfeed with stupid groups and fan pages. Is there no way to filter those? If not there should be. I have trouble finding my friends post. Plus, having to download Facebook messenger is such a drag. Way to overcomplicate something that was simple, you morons.
Good
I agree with mostly everything n everyone the updates suck suck suck.. it messed up my notifications feed now I see everyone's b.s. on both notification n news feed.  I had it set up where I see b.s. on notification feed because it's faster and the important stuff on news feed..I would love to give it a 0 star.
Facebook is downloading but it just won't install to my note3
CONSUMES TOO MUCH SPACE
Supppppeeeeerrrr
It was working fine then one day it started closing on me while I'm in the middle of doing something. All we wanna do is keep in contact with people...which was working...then you start adding a bunch of bs that no one needs or can even use.  It wasnt broke, so why did you try to fix it, cause now you broke....
Nice
Alam
priyal kamble
This newest update is horrible. So now I can't see if I got notifications while looking at most recent? I will be deleting this app until its fixed. Get your s*** together Facebook. You're acting like MySpace.
Stop changing this app. You are not improving it. Still true, months later.
Kelum
Android Rom Especialist  for older version.
What happened go to click on to see who is online loads contacts go to scroll down list all disappear
Need to stop updating because this facebook update made my tablet go slow and go crazy it shud stop
The app....oh the app...where do I begin. Ive put up with its multiple bugs over the years which never seem to be fixed, Ive put up with the constant updates which take up so much space, but this is my line drawn. I didnt choose to update, it updated itself (I dont have it set to auto update) and since the last update it will not log you out. You click log out and it will say logging out for multiple hours. Ive found a way around it but its a time consuming hassle. Just go in your internet browser people.
So many updates already low on space 4 my cp.
Mnguni
Still no app to SD... Now the app won't load, just sits on the Facebook logo page. Maybe ill go back to myspace, or cringe, move to Twitter,
Hai
Facebook is my face book
Default app. No other choices.
It is my main social apps~ and it didn't disappointed me~ NICE APPS~
mina
Just takes up more space & wants access to everything personal, just a case of them trying control & manipulate your life!
This apps is not good after back to back update .I don't like
Simply I love it
Not good..cause everytime hank
<3
Elsa
too many updates,too much space...so slow
too many update
My phone is always full because of this. Too many updates !! It takes too much space. And because of that i can't download games .
Very dirty app please , suggestion to everybody  who ever is downloading or has downloaded uninstall it
But Very Very Expend Space
Please stop the killing.
I really like it but it always takes to much space on my phone.
Zordar
Great to have on standby.
I hate this app. Its slow and crashes constantly. Why can't I reply to specific comments with my S3 mini when I see other android phone users can? I want to be able to reply to certain comments.
Real star
All are perfect in this
Can't comment, can't open a photo, or open to read a long post ......dislike!!!!!!!!
Mm
Fine
Fix it I had to uninstall it to reinstall ihtt because it was freezing constantly. .. kinda annoying.
There have been many updates but its still the same. Every time i need to repick photos in my fb folders (either profile pic or cover photo album) why does it need to RECOPY and UPLOAD THE SAME EXACT COPY OF IT? Thats stupud. Give us some option to re-select....
Awsome
It literally KILLS that I can't tag someone in a group I'm in unless they have commented ON the post I'm commenting on(not even the poster!)This is a MUST-HAVE when it's a time sensitive matter like saving an animals life & I need a response ASAP!!! I'm involved in rescue!! You should be able to tag ANYONE in the group ANYTIME if you're a member, but ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE AN ADMIN & I AM! I shouldn't have to get on my laptop to do it! I ALWAYS have my phone, but NOT always by a computer!!Fix and I'll rate 5
Very nice!
Heera
Things are looking better finally
It's amazing it's all  cool
Im only going to rate this facebook app one star because it keeps crashing on my samsung s3 tablet. Fix it please.
*RECENTLY UPDATED: having to download a separate app to view messages is silly;I'll just use my browser instead of use up extra space on my phone. Timeline stays up to date and can edit profile *easier, but still can't change my cover photo from the app or browser. Not a device error.
Vs
Its great too have
Very slow
Large storage
No more Facebook messenger please
Satish arya
Please make it faster onph ones with only 512 mb of ram
trigerful. download it
I love fb a lot I cannt I've without it ...
Latest update suck, took more time to open the app
Love it
Nice app
Too many updates
Cool
the updated version consume too much space. please bring back the old one which do not consume alot of memory.
Gos is enough for me
Good
This app is always crashing n not loading it's not great at all
Cant open my facebook ince the latest update. It keeps saying just a moment yet ive been waiting for 30 minutes. Pls fix this?
Please  installed this app.I like this app
I hate it
Love it
Superb
Why can't I select Most recent as the default? I don't care what Facebook thinks is most important on my news feed. Also, I'm not installing another app just to read and respond to messages... Ridiculous!
This is bull fix it asap
I wish there was another Facebook app
Because it help to join people
it could be come  better possion but this version is good for this androied mobile...
ok
Love it
I use Facebook often and message people as well on it but I'm not stupid. This app makes you get Facebook messenger to message people just so they can cost you money by making calls without permission and costing data charges and everything. Messenger is a hack and it's done all of what I just mentioned to me
Why it always appear that fb is not responding ?? !!!! Pls fix this. .i regret that i update fb in latest version. .plz FIX ! Thank you
The latest update has caused too much problem. It was working fine before. It is also causing my phone to run slow. "Setting up FB" message everytime I open the app. Lastly, the new update is taking too much space in phone memory. Kindly fix. Thank you.
Love it
Keeps me in touch with old friends and family I don't get to c much.
lovely
Dating marerial
The only good thing you can really say about this app is that it is better than google plus. Which isn't saying much.
First they forced everyone to download messenger, and now everytime I click on a link it appears in 'Facebook Browser', a horrendous browser compared to chrome.
Nana
Since the update it's turned to crap.
No work
Open
I can talk to my friends#awesome
Cool
Lol its fake book not facebook
So far so good
This app is never seems to work properly I'm not getting any notifications when I am logged out even when all the settings are correct, no point reporting a problem because they don't do anything anyway
I Love It but it keeps crashing!!!
Thnks very good
I think that this a plication is very fast well not very fast but its fast
Gone from bad to badder if that's a real word won't even open now. Blue Facebook screen for about 2 seconds then back to the home screen. Why so many useless updates? why no most recent as opening page? Why don't you listen to what people are telling you? WHY? WHY? WHY? Rant over.
Its slow I cant update my live status current city etc so
i love
Felix
New update caused my app to completely stop working have reinstalled 5 times and still nothing, also messenger no longer works as Facebook can't open. Useless update. Galaxy S4 user
I would really love if you's could give us the option to share a post in private message on my Sony xperia T like we can on the computer...
Video stop playing around 21sec most of the time, pls fix it.
Thank you
Aktar
the newsfeed takes forever to load and usually results in an error. I can't default it to most recent activity. finding the settings you want to change is not very intuitive. the separate messenger app is unnecessary, I'm not going to use Facebook messages anymore. when using the app to post comments or like something it never works.
Still crashing on Samsung Galaxy tap 3 Uninstalled restated now it wasn't download
Best
Facebook is obviously having some issues their end of the bargain. Having you ranting at them with unhelpful comments isn't going to make them fix the issues quicker. If you find the updates are taking up too much space, don't install them until you've fully been told the issues you're having has been repaired.  I've had no issues what so ever with Facebook with my phone,  just get an sd card and move stuff to there to free up pace on your phone to help Facebook run more smoothly,  try re-installing it.
Put messages bacj on Facebook app its stupid how yall took it away whg the f@ck do I need someone stocking me like I thought we'd have privacy
Good social network
WTF FY Lager plssss fix this application
You cannot share for a defined list of persons or to exclude someone. Take into account for the next update
Iam don't have facebook
top stories = old stories, no way to pin recent posts all the time?!
Ufff! Just another fake thing
Good app
Loved it
Eating my memory even if not use it.
Wack
Great
Con HTC one molte volte mi crascia nn so perch
Facebook
I had to delete all of my games to instal thiss.....
A
Not working are all...
Gud
Why do we have to update to worse things.  Why try to fix something that is not broken.
We need another Messenger like we need a hole in the head.
Stop all unnecessary updates as it takes up too much space!!!!
I wish you would stop freaking updating this app. It has grown to giant size and I can not uninstall it because it is a factory set app. Every time I open it it glitches out and closes itself. I am very unhappy with this app
Takes up way to much space and it won't delete off of my device. 
Good
Why facebook need to much use memory.. Can you fix it or i will back the old version...
Useless app too much space
Facebook
Great app
Good
Perfect ides  Who doesn't want to talk with their friends  Works perfect on my phone
Haa bhai  shai h... Thoda bhaut shai kam b ker leta h ...mager bhaut heavy app h...watsup jasi speed ki jruret h.....do something buddy....Eb to kuch kr de re bhai:-)
I have to restart my cell phone in order for my fb app to work after i log out of my fb app then i can't go back on my fb unless i restart my cell phone. Please fix the fb app
Don't get my notifications or updated news feed on time needs fixed
recent news feed is very slow, contacts pictures sync doesn't work
Couldn't fault it really. Runs perfectly.
You seriously have to download messenger to see and reply to your measages? There is no zero star. That's what this app deserves. Facebook is going way down hill
Won't open since the latest update, even after a full phone reset. Disappointing...
Good communication
Samsung galaxy Grand 2
If there's a way of connecting people, facebook leads with its simplified methods. It lives in me, it's a magic thata get rid of stressors in a very simple way... GET IT! !
Data theft found!!!
Why i didn't call on my messenger
please rate this apps for better
Thanks
Takes up a lot of space and requires updated often for almost no reason. Also, does not automatically show based on recently.
task! I can't upload my pictures since yesterday. then, turtle loading as always!
I HATE IT
Not sure what updates people are getting  I don't get them all the time
Not bad
I love Facebook as a social media full of nice carding people / community. And like every online community it has a app.
Awesome
Awful keeps coming up not responding also when i go into pictures its freezes and goes out of the app
Giving one more up-date. Not accurate, difficult to access on some days, takes up way too much space. Much easier on desk top to use and also lap top is easier and more reliable.
It should be just the resent news feed and it takes to much space on my phone

Great stuff
No useful updates like the things I keep suggesting (like keeping Facebook birthdays out of my google calendar)  Instead no choice of how to sort feed any more, and now the "recent" feed is even worse without access to the navigation bar at the top! IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T MESS WITH IT!!!
I see no reason why you should have to give credit  card info on an app that is mostly free
After I last updated the app I wasn't getting any of my notifications 2 weeks. I updated the app again hoping it would help but nothing happened. Now I'm just over Facebook.
It freezes all the time and throws me out when I'm doing something on it. Like, what?
Wah I like it
Love
Still not a fan of the new look

Nice update loving it
Amazing!
Facebook
Great app,improved on speed
Love it
its mediocre. it never updates properly. works more times than not. if there were a better app i would much rather it than this one. ive had to uninstall this app 3 times for it to be bearable.
It finally worked great on my Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 and then after updates two weeks ago, it began crashing every time I clicked a notification. I uninstalled it, and reinstalled, to no avail. I guess I will just use Google+ from now on.

Hy
After this last update all I get when I open the app is a blank page
OK before all these updates fb worked fine now all of a sudden it crashes randomly.  Fix it and maybe we will give it better ratings and reviews now it won't even open wth fix it or leave it alone
V nice facbook
Can't even open after updating it
good for social conference but no more time

Luv d way it works on my phone.
Facebook is totally useless for video album I try everything what the internet tips to how to view your video on facebook but it still don't work/ Facebook is a total stupid damm crap for keeping videos  pls fix this  issue all people in Facebook cannot view them videos but I report the problem a lot of times but no respond help center is totally useless too for helping people how to view them videos/ mark zukuberg still ignored this issue
App needs too much of my PERSONAL INFO. , slow, and too simple a color scheme.
Wow
My facebook is keep saying fb not respond what do i need to do....
Over 23 mbs now?!  It's messing my phone up!!!
Call this "updatebook" or "wtfmorespaceneededbook"
Good
It is colourful and the pictures are clear
Every since the last update. The apps keep freezing and laggy. Sometimes i just use the apps for 10 secs and it force close.
Ever since my Facebook app updated it won't let me post statuses or use the keyboard in private messages...not cool Facebook...please fix...
Love it App
Great
Good basic operation
Use Facebook to keep up with family and friends.  Works well!
Happening since the recent update. Have to exit then reopen frequently
I'd really like the ability to change my audience for a post I'm writing to "custom" from the mobile app. You can do this from a desktop browser but not the mobile app still and it seems this is something that would've been fixed a long time ago. Please fix!
Moto G
Superb, nice
On
Hate it
Sexy
Awesome
U guys still havent fix the bug as to where we were able to "turn off notifications" to posts we commented on..Now since the last update im not able to do that anymore?!?! THATS A MUST FIX!!
Before the last update I was able to clear my search list for people I've searched.. now I can't. everything else is OK apart from if I'm scrolling through a group and someone posts a large message and I read it then go back it takes me right to the top of the group again. Pretty frustrating.
Lol
Evwry time I want to watch a video it stops and frezzes!

When you try to make a friend request a grey screen appears and as a result I can't send the request... please fix this problem so that I would give 5 stars
None

Slow cuyy
This app realy helpful but sometimes it goes hang
Since last update my fone has froze and crashed twice... never ever done it before... if it happens again I will delete app untill next update which hopefully will solve it... so 1 star from me
I have a note 2 !! This app is lagging alot plus it's closing by it self !! Plzz fix !! Tnx
I love it...
I like it
An Excellent
good
Set news feed to auto go to recent news instead of top news and ill consider that last star.
Koool
Fb who
I hate how much memory this app takes and how you can't get into your messages unless you download the memory sucking messenger app as well. It's slow and doesn't update my statuses. And it updates itself when I don't want it to... Taking EVEN more space. If I didn't need to keep in touch with my family over Facebook, I wouldn't have this pointless, time wasting, memory sucking app.
I can't open my FB again after updating. If I open the appl it will go off again
I opened a new account and the login wants me to very people who I just invited before it opens up.
I like so much this app
I love using Facebook but the Facebook app is really slow to load but Facebook in the browser is fast.. Please fix
It takes forever to load post....please fix....so many updates but it not correcting the problem
It need night mode,...
After each update, the app just getting slower to open and slower to load and show the content and pics.
V.18, I believe? Anyways, the app I'm using right now for Facebook is much more easier to use than this official app. No more of that "Setting up till ad infinitum" that I had to put up with since the last update. "Setting up" with THIS APP doesn't even assure that you could open your Facebook -.-
Takes up to much space, and videos play on my time line.
Its very good but its telling me a message:error incomplete update i don't know why
App tries to open but fails and have to force close
Zerehun
My pictures or others pictures won't load and it takes forever to refresh my news feed.
Doesnt work
Nice app  update note bad
Aok
Always on mic?
It's facebook guys duuhhhh it's AMAZING
need FB but your app is wonky. It just randomly shuts down when I click links or try to post anything and it is beyond annoying. Please fix.
It's alright
Love it
Sometimes it is slow
This aap not show punjabi in my phone .i am type but not show punjabi .plz fix this problem
It is asking for permissions to things in my phone that it has no need to access!! I will delete the app in a heartbeat before I deal with that!!
Time will tell all I am saying
Facebook is great!!

Freed constantly reloads so you can't scroll very without being sent to the top, not all posts are shown in the feed so your limited to how far back you can view posts, today it won't load at all I am getting a grey screen and then it kicks me out, the app just keeps getting worse with each update
Wonderful

S-OFF your device and root it then you can make etx-sd card and flash GUIapp2sd card like me
Remove browsing links from opening in Facebook.
Keeps crashing. Keeps showing old posts. Rubbish.
After the latest update my phone has started hanging....  opening  the Facebook apps takes more time than usual...please correct it..
Sss b
So with the latest automatic update, Facebook is now just a grey screen.  This is ridiculous, whoever is in charge of this stuff needs to get it together.
Nice app!!
Yo yo it is an awsome app
Good app
OMG
Great
Thanks for inviting messenger, but I want my messages without it
Latest update does not work, starts then crashes back to home screen
Slower speed loading
Its good
Make way easy to search
Thank you Mark, you changed my life and created new generation of social life activities! ;)
I m busy
All I'm getting is a gray screen and a few minutes it loads and it says Setting up Facebook" it takes forever to load. FIX IT!
Takes up too much space. You should make the option to move the app to the sd card.
Works well, though not as well as your Messenger app. At one point the app started to immediately return to my phones home screen after opening. Fixes by clearing data.

After i updated my Facebook can no longer open.
After  i donwnload the latest version... it keeps error while loading news feed and i must re log in over and over again which is says your facebook log in expired
Awesome social app ever
Some ppl complain about having too many updates . But it doesnt annoy me . The app  Every time  gets better and better adding more features and improvements.  The offline Like and comment is brilliant  , videos play smoothly . Am using a  Galaxy S3 as my daily driver and the app runs without problems so far . Tottaly love it ..  a must have
New permission to man microphone and camera just like the messenger app. Uninstalling on all my devices now
New
Its so hassle for me to go online when im in rush because the app didn't appear fast. It always says "setting up facebook" and i hate that
Me i miri :-D
Tiptop

There is a problem in my fb inbox I can't go to my inbox when I click on my Chat box there is come that install the fb messenger otherwise I can't chat on fb :/ plz fix this fb problem as soon :/
Nice

Manly no responce many time crach in new verson
Great
Please add the ability to be able to move the app to the SDcard.  Plus, even though I select to "only" sync with friends that are already in my contacts (sync with Existing contacts), the app sync everyone.  Please fix.  Samsung Galaxy Note 3
After this last update this application keeps crashing. It happens when logging on and off facebook. This application takes up so much of my memory and drains my battery. The messenger needs to be in the app itself and not a seperate app. Some of us can't afford to buy a newer phone for more space. If I could give Facebook 0 stars I would. It's not even worth one star.
I use this app everyday. Keep in touch with family in other states.
Yeah
Facebook
What is up with Facebook freezing all the time and i have to uninstall and reinstall
You would think when you load most recent posts it would load the most recent.....but it doesn't and that's annoying Zuckerberg!
Old version
This app gets slower after each update and eats up the phone memory. Best solution is to go back to the factory version.
Great
Nice
Baik
I've never installed this app, and never will. Just by reading the reviews im convinced that this app sucks... Appears to take a huge chunk of RAM and Space. Freezes and slows down phone with background activities....worst of all is the permissions it asks. No way am i ever installing this POS.
Hi    Hi He
Updates made it more worse then before,crashing again and again, more space occupying plus crashing system what the hell f.b team is doing can't you design a good Android app which is lite n best
Uses 4 gigs when I don't even use it. won't cut off Internet usage when not in use. HORRIBLE!
I love & I like this app because there are many things to say that I have been the most important part n
Was the best it's been in a while until the most recent update. I don't like how you took away the options to see notifications while scrolling through your news feed without going back to the previous page.
Masth
Wants you to update to new messenger and won't let you access your messages. Hate this
App seems to auto update news feed anytime it wants and scrolls to the top even if you're in the middle of reading older post on your feed. Like icon turned back to gray after you restart the app later. Sharing a post doesn't allow you to post to individual friend only friends. Seems like the last 3 updates are only creating more problems then they are fixing. 
Keeps freezin an not updating an now i cant get it to work load up fone anymore
It won't let me download the app
I want to disable open link in external browser. Because I like it and smart and fast feture to open link, But when I update a last version it missing.
If I don't want to see a persons status or pictures I will block it we as consumer do not need your system personalizing our news feeds
Takes up too much space
Good to use
After this last update I can't see pics as well as I no longer get any notifications. Every single update something goes wrong. Very annoying.
Tim
Crashes constantly since last update on samsung galaxy tab 3
I'm sick of insufficient space pop up on my phone every time I do an update. I uninstalled it just to reinstall again so it fits on my phone.
This is not good app
Yeap.
Since Facebook decided to update on its own I have had nothing but problems trying to view anything. All I get is a bunch of errors and a gray screen.... Not a happy camper.
It's cool
Nice
Like and share automatically

Great Web site, well managed and user friendly.

Aap is ok but it takes too much of phone memory. It should be made light or the the aap data should be stored in memory card.
Thanks and amazing
Was working fine for weeks now it doesn't even open tried uninstalling the reinstalling still not working please fix
I cant make a free call the icon is not there..why?

It's crashing more often than last couple of months. Every time when it's updating, it's showing up a blue page with "setting up" message for about half an hour....dezinstall and then install. I'm thinking serious to quit this app for good!
Great
I love it
Im really disspointed. I can't message via my facebook app. I have to download messanger. So that you gyus can take hieghest rating in downloading f.b. messanger just as facebook app.. And that sucks.
That is good but some time it creats a problem and can not open....
I am not interested
Love it
This app is good but few days later google ne massenger install krn nu kehta oh gl changi nhi mainu fb di app v rakho nalle massenger v esnu thik kro pehla vangu rkho

Within a few seconds of opening this app it closes. So frustrating. Needs a major fix!!! Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 user.

Sweet Roy..
Facebook
Facebook app. For mobile phone
All
good
Sure, its the Facebook app, so you get it. Still, if there was a Basic for simple use of the system and then a Deluxe for what we have now, that would be better...except we all know that "Deluxe" would jump to ten bucks...
Good
Facebook app is nice way of direct login...... Fast and easy...
Not so bad
Yep
rediculous....
Sexy
I refuse to install messenger to be able to read my mails. It can't be legal to block someone from access their mails
OPEning oF app S bry Slow We r nEed mor Speed 2 it S
Laggs as hell on my Snapdragon 800 Quadcore CPU!!!? Srsly???? If you load more comments you have to scroll up everytime!! No quick change to recent stories anymore. No sharing into a message possible, further don't get link of a post.  Links to facebook content dont open with the app (like twitter). Cannot expand notifications. No Multitasking support. Many areas aren't native implemented (webcontent).
Stupid auto-refresh will scroll the feed back to top WHILE I'm browsing it. Also, when using other apps and coming back to FB, it does not remember the last view. And now it looks like it crashes my browser all the time..
Love Facebook
The best way
It needs an extra data eating messenger app , I think Facebook should integrate it with it's own app ...
I only use it to contact family in bulk.
Sucks balls....
Excellent
Im looking forward to this app
Facebook
I can't scroll through the pictures.
This apps updates almost every week or sometimes twice a week and now its been crashing most of the time. The app will auto close and I only see fewer and fewer post of my friends.. I only got 300+ friends but I only see posts of less than 10% of em.. sigh.. please fix.
Can't even load the App, it stopped everytime I tried to load it. The update is not good.
Facebook app can be slow at times. I have shut my whole phone down and restart it in order for it to work
Force close won't even open...turned to junk
Nice
Thanks fb
Too much friendly
No better way to communicate with those that aren't close to u, u can let them know how was the experience through pictures and comments.
Not reinstalling on my xperia miro. I found my phone a lot more faster just using messenger!
Nice app
jmaina
I don't want the stupid messenger and don't want to update the app and this morning it updated itself without my permission,when I try to uncheck auto update it does not unmarked!!!!! Wtf????!!
My fb app is crashing :(
Update? To much. Memory
I like this
Slow slow slow
...the most hated iOS feature to me will always be inability to open links in browser of your choice. Now as the only app maker you just introduced the biggest iOS flaw to android. Bonkers.
Asiedu
It takes large space of memory
Its slow and likes to scroll back to the top on its own. Won't let me see my friends list. I try a post and it won't post sometimes, I can try n try but I end up turning my cell off for it to work >:-/
Useful
I love it
Awesome application l
Although i love the fb app the last 3 updates ive recieved have all ben for the same thing sort it out guys, actually give us something new to enjoy
Itz social networking...
Nice
Please keep 'most recent' feeds as the default. I don't care what's popular among other people on my feed. If I did, I'd probably be hanging out with them, not stalking them on Facebook,  secretly judging their life. Also, since the last update, I can't edit my comments after posting? Lame.
Thuu
Good
No pictures load after waiting for 10 mins +, no option to view groups, loading times are abysmal, no care has gone into this app, instead of improving its fundamental features it constantly updates to new and more confusing designs. Many more problems but its just no worth my time tbh.
So match space !!!!!!!!!
for the Love of God, just let our default browsers do the job. I don't want you to open youtube links in a low quality browser. I HAVE MY OWN YOUTUBE APP! stop invading our user experience! make that horrible feature OPTIONAL so we can turn it off forever.
A.k

COSMA COSMA
Everything was working fine till today, I can't even open it.
When I scroll down all I see are the videos that people liked and it frizes my phone. It seems like you guys have no idea of how to fix those issues and you still updating this app every week without any results.
It eats up all the space of my mobile. Also it covers the whole ram and heats up my phone. Please fix this. I will install the app at next week.
This program sucks lately...everytime i click on a page or picture it goes back to my icon page. EVERYTIME. I have reinstalled it three times. Fix this or i will delete it permanently
Just got new update description says speed improvement but its completely working opposite. App takes more than 2 min to start second most of the time app get crashed third overall phone performance got effected.

Always  it needs to update in a week I'll update twice... So this is useless. Apppp
I'm alright with everything on the app with the exception of the messenger function. Because of the reveals of what information is being shared through messenger, I uninstalled the separate app. Now I cannot message anyone unless I'm on a computer. Thanks.
Glitches and closes out every 5-10mins
The app works great but the service is just ok.
After the recent update, it just keeps on crashing everytime I try to open it.

Why fix it if it's not broken!? News feeds are terrible and behind, I always get yesterday's and the day before news feeds  instead of current day. And I see that nobody really reads these reviews I see other people complaining also! ...New updates are making the app crash!!!  PLEASE stop, too many updates!! Stop changing MY settings to the way you want them to be, every update I have to reset them? Why??? Now we're being forced to install messenger? WOW!Messed up
I hated it because this is super eating storage and the setting up facebook is loading and loading , and just a moment is loading and loading and its low on space and I hated facebook.
1 star for the intrusive permissions.
I love Facebook

Had to update for the upteenth time. And now it won't even load. I'm getting tired of facebook just because of all the updates and unreliability
Why cant you improve.
Whenever you update, post, and log in, it consumes more and more space. Too bad for gadgets that have a small phone memory. It doesnt allow any applications to download because it consumed all the remaining spaces on my phone.
After updated , fb being slow and slowwww
Gotta  have this
Jjjj
I  like Facebook.
It help us to comunicate pele around the world
Extra
Good for my life
just done update dated 2 oct 2014 and still keeps closing down. Obviously not compatible with android 4.4.2 on my tablet. Poor rating given may go higher if this problem is fixed
It does not work for needs.
tssskkk so disappointed!! it takes a lot of memory space..!!! so annoying that if you open messages it will transfer first to the messenger!! what the ****.. then if you dont have the messenger apps you are oblige to install it first before you open your mes..
Yoooooooh kol shwaya momry space kol shwaya w msh 3ayz y update :/
My Sony Xperia E1 cannot install Facebook app anymore.

Make it easier for people who are in groups to find posts they have made.  If you go to activity you cannot dp anything with your post once you find it.
Crash
Commitment, communities, contentment, , communication....work in life...
It crashes and closes every five to ten minutes... Please fix...
New update doesn't let me even open Facebook! I click on it, it looks as if it's loading then BAM! It kicks you out. Real sorry update....very disappointed
Does what it needs too. Nothing fancy.
suhgffu
Very sneaky with the new browser. No notice or anything. Had to figure it out myself. Shady.
Prepare to see this message a lot: Facebook is not responding, do you wish to close it?
What happen to this app???!!!.
videos don't stream.. the app simply closely automatically
For the love of God, stop it freezing and crashing!
No to dislike
Is EVEN SLOWER than before! Ugh. Please fix!!!!!
App is good but I still suffer error loading on my news feed can please fix this.
If it didn't use so much space and update on time id give it five stars.
I love fb app
This app takes around 100MB after login. Due to this device lagging and freezing. Pls fix it.
All day yesterday the app wouldn't open. When I click on it it will load my news feeds then close and its doing this again today. Plz fix

Too big and crashes with updates

Thanks

Only problem can't move to SD card
When ever we connect to FB, it should connect directly to most recent posts.

OLD Facebook
After I updated the app it became so laggy and so slow. Not worth the 5stars nor 4, 3 or 2. Worst update

The recent update made the app crash at ALL TIMES. Now I'm stuck with the facebook in my browser.

Almost everyweek there's an update! So annoying!
Blh arr
Hate the game requests I get.
We love to hate it.
Say you update speed. NO change. Make me get messenger. It's huge. Small size phone can't do it. Rumors of spying and info stealing. Sorry but you deserve a one. Good day.

There is no way i can use this app because it crashes whenever i load it to a profile, group or notification every time i do it crashes. The update you gave the app did nothing to solve the problem either. This app is the only one that does it on my devise my friends have the same problem and as well as i and are so close to uninstalling it. U have a week to fix it or we will uninstall it. I dont waste my time with this kind of silliness. Its a simple fix. I thought crashing was a thing of the past.
I am using FB a longtime ago. A very useful to meet live with friends, well-wishers.
What......very much amateur.
OK
Since new update Facebook doesn't work. I only a grey screen..... Get a grip. HTC One.
Excellent
Love Facebook
Only good for a quick check on your FB, but isn't capable of all you might need to do on there.
The download takes too long for me.
Sweet
hate!!
This is not installing in kitkat 4.4
Great
I loves this application...it's so great
Takes forever to load. Before I could finish reading the older posts, it refreshes itself and takes me to the most recent posts at the top of the page. I get fed up of scrolling down to the last post I just read. Waste of time!
facebook
I hate that it auto updates without warning. And I think its stupid that youve taken off some of facebooks functions ie the messenger.  There was no need to remove it from the app
Dk
This is awesome

If you dont want facebook uninstall or turn off, dont complain about it. This app has made leaps and bounds in 2 years! If it loads slow maybe you need a real smartphone losers. Quit getting the free 50$ phone your providor offers....using htc m model and galaxay tab works great on both devices and loads as fast as any other app on ether device.
Awesome
It's good but i can't reply to comments on it like i can my iPad Facebook app, and plus i hate that they forced me to download Facebook messenger on both my android phone and Apple iPad, but it's not that bad on my LG phone because i get a floating bubble that allows me to message people no matter what app i'm in, sadly on my iPad that's not the case, on my iPad i have to open the messenger app if i ever wanna reply to someone, it gets bothersome to say the least.
There is anything else to say about this app.. Such a wonderful fb after updating
Ohh please too many update, will you stop this
Soe
Evrdy quite gud
Don't Update your Facebook Guys, This update is Garbage, It Loads & Loads, Nothing more to do..
I'm ready to kill fb account
Good but message some time cant open if it dont have FB Chat program

After it updated, I couldn't open the app again, even after I uninstalled and installed it. This is so annoying

You have to go to your Internet browser to open a Facebook link that's y always use to miss my iPhone because of the inbuilt facebook browser. Now with the latest update of Facebook it's possible in android.
Very annoying keeps crashing, cant post as crashes,  scroll a few posts crashes again, SORT IT!!!!
It canceled the option to open a link inside the app instead of a browser. It was one of the usefull thing you did, why did you canceled it?? :(

Why do you automatically go back to the top of the news feed when I'm in the middle of reading a post making me have to scroll forever to go back to where I was?
I remember when this didn't freeze on me every other time I used it. I remember when my Most Recent feed WASN'T hidden & I ACTUALLY had a choice for either the Most Recent or this other feed

It's slow. It constantly has 'error loading feed' messages and it's uses A LOT of RAM.  You'd think Facebook could get a basic thing like getting an app to work properly right. Lidl can manage it......

Plz not downlode this apps is not open  i try hear..
last update says improvement for reliability and speed.. where's the speed your talking now? it keeps on saying setting up facebook after a few mins it says facebook is not responding.. i cant even use it now!
Still no good updates from admin useles phone memory requres
Already had plenty of issues, but since the last update, every time I open the app, (assuming that it actually opens & "functions"), it crashes within 5-10 minutes. After crashing, or if I close it, my phone goes haywire and nothing works - phone has to be restarted.
Nice to c people doing good especially all whomever i haven't seen for a while:)
It constantly updates thereby consumes more space. Should be able to go on sd.

Any way I can give a negative star rating?!?!?  How could they have made this worse AGAIN?!?!  Recent update now only works when NOT connected to ANY wifi and consistently freezes and will not update.   Also instead of having top stories be the primary, how about allowing us to choose most recent feeds as the constant opening.  Way to out do yourselves FB!

Superb
Its wiping out my note 3 memory...... Its awful...
after the latest update, this app always crashes with no reason. please fix!

What exactly is being updated? Cause I still have the same problems I had six months ago... I Still don't see recent posts it takes forever to load so what exactly is being updated?
I really enjoy the social Media
I use it. It's a good way to stay in touch with certain people. I hate the many unnecessary changes it always goes through. But will use for the foreseeable future, sadly.
What's new?

I don't even use Facebook that much and it works for what I use it for (scrolling up and down the page) but it would seem that from judging by the brilliant 1 star reviews here, I'm wondering if you're working with a team of highly trained retards that only make a mess of each update (and because you release an update everyday, you keep the changelog the same: faster and more reliable. Shut up. I've never seen any app that updates to frequently but changes so rarely. Scrap the app and rebuild it.
kishan
Its ok. but, the speed its to slow
I still rely on fb to put me into contact with my friends worldwide.
Because we can chat
Always loading
can't complain
Like this app
Every time I try to load it freezes, then crashes. Please address this.
But sometimes it takes a while to make a go faster than it's takes along time,
Broken after new update.    Running CM10.1u
It keeps on freezing and then exiring by itself. Annoying.
It is sweet
Latest updates have been so kind enough to crash the app in my nexus5 each And every time . totally irritating removed the app

Ever since I updated my Android, Facebook mobile won't even install. Gives me error 24, but there's no fix it solutions
The vids load slow on my wifi, idc that they load- certainly not helpful, but it pulls me from where I am on page to the vid. Also why separate all the facebook apps... guess I can just delete this one and only fb feed on computers... that's nice?
Very good update guys.
Too slow
4 stars should have more search options with the groups or another app for groups you administration or are a member of . Approving posts sucks have to use zero dot fb
Just a moment....................................................................................................
Fix the app.  Samsung Galaxy 3.
It always say that, FACEBOOK ISN'T RESPONDING. Why?
Awesome app man like it
I'm with everyone else.... this app is crap but the developer don't care nor listen. Its pointless to have the app when. It runs better on opera for movie....
I got the galaxy              and this is not working properly!!!      log out by itself?       *I got message I can get it

Hi komada
Ms Julia
Dislike having to also get the messenger app
Quick
Always errors on uploading new feeds
Keep it up fb
Mr.manish
nice app
It seems like every time you turn around there is another update screwing up what you just got used to. I have yet to see a lot of improvements with these updates. It's hard to justify them when you have to delete other apps just to be able to update facebook so it will run.
Social app
Recent update did nothing but just made the app completely useless. Doesn't even start up now. Your updates doesn't do anything at all but just adds more and more space to use up memory. Either your app development team is ignorant or you just completely ignore all the user feedback. Get a clue. Don't screw with something that's working properly
Political bullshit. Facebook taping onto your phone. Invasion of privacy.
Excellent

It's Fantastic!
Love it
Its a really good app
It freezes and then it just keeps saying loading
what heck Facebook? seems it is the most worst update? always "just a moment" til it has no response? do I have to restart my phone to use or close all the application before using it? 1star for this!
Terbaikk
I went to update the new version and the program kept force closing. Now that i have installed to the basic version it is telling me i have insufficient storage when there is more than enough space on my phone. Please fix!

Alright
This apps forces me to download the Messenger!fix that!!
Great
I like it
I feel so good after using it
Facebook for android
Updats to much
Facebook has way too many permissions requests that IMHO is a privacy invasion. They can edit your wall, contacts, listen in through mic. I'm a security & privacy fanatic. Just don't like any app having that type of access to my emails, contacts etc.
I'm so wonder, why you guy make it to so much update? Look like 1time per week. If it still like this i will stop to support it.
Everytime i touch a post to like or comment,or just watch a video the app shuts down and i have to start over and scroll through to find the post again.hate it
STILL Randomly freezes and i have to force close it.
The app is very limited in functional use. You still have to use a browser and computer to get access to a lot of the functions including privacy settings and now messages. The app keeps getting bigger and bloated yet it does less and less.
Samsung Galaxy S3
High class
i can't even see News feed...i regret my self for updating
......but listen to your users!!  :-)
Whenever I try to download,  it says cant be downloaded due to an error
Very good features
Where is my old face book. ..
Love it.
Swallow a lot of ram. 50- 60Mb ram when running
The new update causes fb to crash on logging out. Please fix it.
Good
hi good
Nawapenda wote
It takes too much space on the phone
It loads too slow ! N its frustrating me.Only if you can update it
I'm sick of browsing far into my feed, and then while reading something, all of the sudden I'm at the very top of my feed, and then I have to scroll ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN to finish reading what I was looking at.
Wonderful app
Like it
Getting good. "It Need's" 1. most recent for any time we get on fb. 2. "Friends of friends" settings in post we share 3. Reload without it saying "can't reload post" fix the bugs & problems with it. & continue to make Facebook even better. Doing good so far. I wanna see something more new & impressive.
Good to have
Sucks.
I have never commented on an app before now and the reason I am is this is garbage. It takes forever to update news feeds and comments and like previously stated in comments here, it's way behind. I wish I could un update this like you used to be able to. I used to like Facebook but now it seems to be more of a bother and inconvenience than anything. Please fix this. It used to be good.
Its good social network full of all kind of network
Not sure what the issue is, but, I keep getting a msg in app that my version of FB is outdated, yet when I go to Google play store, there's no update button, but it shows today's date (10/02/14) as an updated version. Uninstalled/reinstalled just to make sure, but no effect. Also, I no longer get push notifications for app OR updates! Please fix this!
This app takes up to much space. Figure it out
Worst then ever
Whats happening to fb app? My tab keeps on crashing evrytime i use fb.This ia really really bad.We dont need to get fb app always updated.The simple, the better.Do something about it.This is really annoying.pfffff
Google updated the android OS on my galaxy tab 3 on labor day weekend.  Since then FB crashes 8-10 times per 5 minute browsing session.  I had hoped FB would fix it, but it's been over a month!  Please, please fix it!
wow
I updated my Facebook app and now its not loading anything...this needs to be fixed
My Facebook won't refresh since the update
I'm so not liking the new update... Everything I see is from weeks ago or from yesterday... change it back!!! Videos don't play or it crash...absolutely hate this app
Nothing loads.. news feed never "refreshes".. force stop all the time! Shall I keep going!!!??
This new update as of October 2nd has just messed up Facebook can't post, isn't loading, won't do anything. Fix it or I'll delete my Facebook. I'm fed up with your shooty updates that you mess up daily.
Don't care what happened yesterday.  Give us the latest postings; or at least an easily accessible option to do so. Stupid can't fix stupid.
New update sucks can get anything to load
Veeru
Update fail
I Just Did Most Recent update. Now my Phone Keeps Freezing When I Try To Edit A Post!!! PLEASE FIX!!!
It takes over 5minutes to open app
Updated and now nothing works
Its the best
It won't update my status now or show anything new in my news feed
To many updates that create the same number of problems they fix. Constantly unable to update my news feed. Please fix and I'll gladly rate higher.
I love facebook so much i am always on facebook in my house outside the house every where i go i am on facebook that is how much i love facebook thank you to  who ever made facebook
Never works right with all these updates. Leave it alone if it aint broken
Have had nothing but messages being not sent. Please make this work right.
Absolutely nothing loads. Fix please
Nice and good. It connects the frenz......
Crashing constantly galaxy tab 3 10.1
Like many others Im not a fan of thw IM being seperate...otherwise fine
This app is very easy and very good
Nothing will load!
Why is it that FB needs access to anything I have stored on my phone AND SD CARD?  What possible reason can justify you needing access to the CAMERA AND MICROPHONE on my phone?   (I really do want an answer to this message! )
Just updated  it and now I'm won't load or update  my status. fix it....
It's reeeeeeeeaaaaaalllllyyy slow... Taking forever for news feed to load then when it does, it only loads about 20 posts then nothing...
After update the app, it take a long time to open the app and not so long after the app open, it force close by it self
Is rocking nw fb makes life enjoyable n easier thanks fb team
It regularly freezes & shuts downn. On & off it just doesn't work. It's like I don't have an internet connection, but I do. Every other app works along with Google. Not to mention half the posts don't show if I click most recent, but they show on the top stories post (which I & most people HATE). JUNK JUST JUNK!
Gettin worse just goes to site....cant take this stupid app anymore
Longer
Why can't you just make it with some abilities and options as same as Facebook on the web. For example if someone tags me and i want to show it to a list of friends Only i can't do that! And i can't share with a new custom lists.
The new update is the,only thing I'm not completely satisfied about it changed the feed look and now I cannot swipe to,the left to see friends or swipe right like before the new update. Now,it
Awsome
..if I could put it on my sd card so it wouldn't use up so much internal memory.
need some improvement
Very cool !!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!
It sucks now.  Should've left the private message feature, the way it was.  Using messenger to send private messages blows chunks, like Jimmy Hoffa in a mafia woodchipper.
100
App acts like there no network. Never posts my comments our on my timeline and send to just jump back hours in the timeline. Useless app. Updates every few days and nothing changes for the better.
really super
Keeps cutting out sometimes doesn't let me type anywhere, and when reposting it doesn't show up on LG volt
Using most of memory while in background.
Naveen
About 50%of clicks on a link will put the app in background.
It's o.k......but fed up with updates. ...Every week.....its 2 much
STILL FORCE CLOSING AND CAN BARELY POST! What is the point of the app if i can't even use it?  I try to do anything and it kicks me out.
Images loading too slow
Stop pushing frequent updates until something really change.
It's an ok app but it crashes way too often. Even scrolling slowly makes it crash. The stability issues need to be addressed asap.
I love this,
good..
Where do I begin. This is an endless vortex of BS daily horse s*** ridiculousness,Fantasyland insane conundrum of fun. You get to like a lot of stuff. Share some stuff and downright get into everybody else's business have fun!!!
It all right

Can't opened after installing new update...
; ( space
Slow
Always see the same thing when opened it..
Ok
I am getting disgusted with this fb...its occupying a large space on my phone...also its not movable to SD card....if u please fix that....bug.,.,..next time I will definitely rate u 5 stars !!!!!!
Useless
Takes up to much space.  Freezes up.  Doesn't show comments. Needs newd feed update button.  Videos automatically playing is stupidest feature.
I have trouble getting past the log in page! It barely loads and when it does it freezes all the time!! Waste of space.
When I go for  upload picture as profile pic , why its asking for crop . It should be as it is option also .
This latest update sucks! Whenever I try to open it, it shows setting up Facebook and then shows just a moment and then it shows not responding. This is ridiculous! How could you let these updates without triggering it once. I want a reply for this. I want it to fix this bug as soon as possible. I want a reply from your team.
A very good app
Excellent
Good communication
Beyond satisfaction
Thua app is verry worse. Always updating but nothing changes. The new upadte is gettin' stock! Everytime i scroll down to see my newsfeed l. The thing i hate always crashing im reading some post sunddenly will crash. !
Plus ten,everybody in they momma use this.theres always room for safety and privacy improvements.
After new update videos are taking long time to loading. . Super slow...... and news feed also not showing the new posts.. every thing going wrong way.... can you do something for this. ...
Needs updates that will decrease RAM consumption
Facebook
Love
HAHAHAHA
ZERO privacy, HUGE SPACE HOGGER, way too many updates.  Deleting the app and just using FB through the browser.
Facebook shouldnt need or be able to access my cell phone information.  To remove the massaging system that was in the app only to create another one, 2  Remove the first and Make it unusable,  makes zero sence.  Unless there is a agenda. I as a business owner know, people dislike change therefore there must be good reason ( benefit for said change) for the change. If I want my location on, my phone has the ability as do I, to make that known. Facebook and Google= central intelligence agency!
How many times can you call it an update when the "What's new" section doesn't change. Or are you just fooling people into believing you're fixing something when you're really not? The last 3 times I updated, I've seen no changes except for the amount of space you demand. Either do what you say & update something, or leave it the way it is & lose more accounts. Oh and FYI, if I wanted to read about stuff that happened 2 weeks ago, I'd scroll back to 2 weeks ago. People want to see recent news! Not old news!
I use Facebook a lot anyway so it's good to have a mobile app for it.
Smooth & user friendly..
5update now uninstall it!!! :-(
Always updating I'm gonna just use my browser
Good
i love fb...
It is amazing
Very good
New embedded browser/bloatware. IM still annoyingly in another app.  Ignores and overrides system preferences to disable vibrate for notifications.  Doesn't make use of Nexus 7 screen: No tablet features, and tiny buttons and text in places, like the share dialog.  Unpleasant.
Takes too much of ram space and takes too long to load new posts

Dont like it all my memory gone no storage space
I hate it when it updates everytime, it eats up the memory on my tablet. And also, it doesn't open up immediately after updating.
luv this
Nothing  Has Been Wrong Lately  It's Perfectly Fine.
Fix the messaging app
Not liking to be forced to use messenger to get my private messages from mobile devices.
I gave it 3 stars 2 years back, but I guess fb has updated a lot. I must say I am impressed with it now. Still a bit sloppy but I believe it will improve in coming days. Please decrease the mb size for God sake its taking 186.14 mb alone on the phone. It eats a healthy bit of your RAM.
"Face book setting up,,,,just a moment"....suck!
Galaxy tab keeps crashing
Xiv
Like
not bug fixes update . my phone huawei g510-0010 & can't open video and downloading. repair next update
Very fast
I simply can't live without Facebook haha. Love everything about the app just that I wish changing between most recent and top stories was easier and also still needs performance improvement especially when it's loading content
Zang
I like Facebook and I use it every day but hate that it ALWAYS shows Top Stories!!! Fix it please! Also, please stop it from going back to the top of my feed after I've read an article or something!
Crash!!
Vvvv nyc
Great
In the last several weeks this app does nothing but force close. I'll be in the middle of typing a comment and the whole app just stops and goes back to my main screen. I've noticed that my news feed doesn't refresh either, but that isn't as big of an annoyance as the whole app crashing 7/10 times that I'm using it. For the amount of space this takes up on my phone, I would hope for a better quality application. I hope this will be fixed soon, otherwise I'll be removing the app altogether.
About Kathe Mosley I want her not to be on Facebook no she is not my friend
It is taking forever to load news feed! Profiles won't load or anything! Fix it
facebook

Good
Still is bad, on my phone, it doesn't want to load anything!...
Facebook is da business
App disappears for no reason what so ever. Uses way to much space. Total Garbage in my opinion.
Now not only fb messanger but fb app too can do what ever it wants with your phone if you look at permissions, i liked using fb but now im done until they protect privacy instead of invading all of it
This app made my phone slow
Title says it all.  Already consumes large amounts of space. Nothing really special compared to simply using the mobile site through Chrome... Oh, except you can't access your messages here without an extra app... And you can in the browser.  No thanks Facebook, I'll pass.
It's ok
Shib kumar
Love it. What a superb app
Awsome
Awsm
News feed does not update, nor does it update correctly. I can't edit the privacy of events that I host! Let me report comments and stuff! When I click notifications in my drop down bar on my screen, it goes to my News Feed, but it says Notifications in the app! Please fix!
If you like Facebook, do NOT update to the recent one. It will not load. Me AND everyone of my friends that got the download can't even open the app.
Phone storage out of space.
It randomly shuts down. Please fix
I like this page and use easily.
Excellent
Amazing
Nice update
just wish my news feeds would be the most recent ones
I <3 it!!
This last update sucks! Nothing loads right, won't load at all, or loads so slow that I give up and go do something else!!! I hate it!
There are a lot of  notifications that you will receive but I cannot download a picture, I do not know. :(
Always log
It Goes Slow

I like it a lot when its faster.
This late update has problems loading my news feed. I get the error loading message a lot.
Having a hard time finding the old posts in fact can't find them at all
Super
It is gd app for fast chating and other
Good
It takes so much of space please decrease this app size
dounnload
Thanks
Why update if I can't like a comment? I am also seeing older statuses. Why am I not seeing updates? Please fix these issues ASAP!
Love it
I even can't open it . Too slow ~
It keeps me from being bored
cant open it...fix it!!!
App keeps force closing or freezes. Now I can't like statuses, another crap update
You made me get a app that only does nothing and now i can't get rid of it you know what you deserve to never make anything
I'm having to reinstall it because who knows why it stopped working. Make this app better!
For example, it says a friend last logged in 15 hours ago on mobile, but that friend was actually online, say, 30 minutes ago. I have to clear all the data and log in again so that it finally says 30 min ago. I have the same problem with Messenger.
Muito bom
Very useful for fast uploads and everything from status changes to posting, events and it's all free!
Awesome
I can't do anything on the app it keeps shutting down
Bloated, buggy, resource hogging, memory leaking crapware. This app can bring an overclocked nVidia Tegra 3 to its knees. It has become so broken, I doubt if it can be fixed. There was good reason to fork messenger function into its own app. I think messenger ended up with the brains during the dissection. Seriously Zuckypoo, I expected better.
Please fix this ASAP
Really how many updates are yall going to do. Almost every time I open the app I get an error. Or I see post that 12 hours old at the top of the news feed. This is getting very old very fast.
Just did the new update and can't see any post by anyone on news feeds. Just says no post to show! !! On my galaxy S5
Facebook won't load!! It's stuck on the blue page saying just a moment. I've restarted my phone. I've uninstalled the app and it still won't work!!!
This app  is not workin.... plzzzz fix d bug... nw i m unable to see posts photos etc etc...
Rrrr
Love to enjoy with fren
Too much updates
The previous version was much better.. This idiotic version not even opening properly and simply wasting time and data..it crashing each time u open it..don't download it...
fix this crap Mark Z
Awesome!
I can't log out!!
Love it I can stay in touch with everyone I know
You could do away with needing access to everyone's info !!!
Just got an update and it's slow to load and I'm not seeing many pics or videos, its just blank and won't load. What kind of update was this? It should improve the app not make it worse!!!
Just fixed. ...
Taking forever to load recent posts. And all I can see are old ones. I know out of my hundreds of friends SOMEONE has updated in the last 2 hours!!!!!!! Kinda ticking me off. Fix it and I'll give it 5 starts again
Hate top news... We the people like choice. My first comment was back in april, and still we have to go searching for the recent feed... also, the newest update that just came out won't load ANYTHING.
need feed won't load half of the time.
It lags on posting comments and lags on notifications as well
Just installed the 2nd update I've received this week. Now my news won't refresh. Wtf Zuckface?
This Facebook app makes my face red with anger too much freezing & I have a new phone with 4g wtf?
Been using this app since December 2009. Use it daily. Stops working if you don't immediately update. Screw you.
App doesn't work.....ratchet
Since yesterday my fb is not working it says just  a moment and thats it
I honestly don't know how I would run my buisness without this app. Keeps me in contact with customers friends and helps me find employee's
Okay so one minute my Facebook is acting just fine but then I update it and now its all screwy. It won't let me search people and it won't load anything, even my news feed. This is ridiculous.
NOTHING LOADS !!!!! Warning to all!!!Don't bother with it! im deleting the app until further notice of a better update ... I rate it a zero if I can
Hate it. I'm not going to allow anyone to spy on me
New update on 10/2 rendered a nearly useless app totally worthless. Will not load. Will not update news feed. If I could give it zero stars I would.
Won't load my newsfeed at all
New update now makes my Facebook app crash and freeze up during the loading of comments or more posts.
Since update it won't let me see the new information on wall and it keeps closing itself.  What is wrong with these updates....every time it gets worst..ERROR message all the time and to make it worst the information on the news wall is old of two days or hours.....who will  want to see two days info......completely out of range! Uffff.  Grrr YOU GUYS NEED TO FIX IT.
New update won't show Gallery thumbnails.  Please fix!
News feed won't even load anymore after New update. Need to fix it.
Wish I could give no stars. Installed latest update now nothing will load. Blames my internet but everything else connects just fine!  Waste of space on my phone if its not even going to work!
Updating when it shouldn't
Would someone in this company please figure out when an SD card option will be built into this app. Some of my apps have to get downgraded or uninstalled in order for this app to fit on my phone. Sometimes this app needs to be reinstalled in order for it to be up to date. I still like this app but I would like to be able to move this app so that my phone internal storage isn't in state of alarm.
Is like been close in a box nothing new...takes to much memory
Hate the new update,  super slow,  lagging,  just blows in general.  Boo.
It's not loading
Its not working!!!
Shizz
EVERY UPDATE MAKES THIS APP WORSE IT TAKES WAY TOO MUCH SPACE AND NOW ITS JUST LOADING I CANT ACCESS MY ACCOUNT AND I CANT CONNECT ANY APPS TO MY FACEBOOK
Facebook will not even load now. Really? Please fix!
Will not load my news feed!!!!! Keeps saying error plz fix very soon
Preston Garner
I downloaded most recent update and now says no longer supported on my android device. Update device now!  What! I've only had this phone a year. Is there a way to uninstall update so I can still use facebook! My phone is the ONLY internet I have
App wouldn't load so I updated and it still won't load. So over it!
HATE the new update! Too many unnecessary changes.
Will not load on my tablet at all.
BE TURNT
Just did new update and now it won't load properly and interferes with my games loading that use facebook "paramon" "summoned war"
Its hung i dont like it
Now it won't update news feed after recent update.
Don't be so demanding people, is just a free app and it's just for fun.
Would much rather have the option to display the most recent feeds by default.
Very Good
Made a lot of imrovements! :)
Do any of your developers even proof of test updates? After your latest sorry excuse for an update, this is officially the slowest, most glitch app on my Note 3
Every update is worse than the last!! How do we switch the feed to show most recent posts  instead of top stories first? If only I could actually get the app to refresh the news feed...Please fix the bugs and give us what we want!!

Wow Facebook isn't working after I updated it this is shocking
Every week update it what a rabish
It seems like Facebook updates on a constant basis and it never seems to get better. Just updated earlier today and now it won't even load the newsfeed, I can only see things from 6 hours ago. So much for being the "best" social media site.
Great!
Its bettrr to use than in internet
Need to be able to tag my pages and artist/fan pages in comments.
Updated today on its own and now won't load news feed (recent or top stories). What happened? Before the update everything was up to date. After the update, not so much.
but it takes a lot of space and i can't even move it to external. PLS FIX!!! PLS!
Like a boss :)
OK
Sucks!!
Needs,an acknowledge button along with the like button..
Facebook WAS working just fine until this last update....now won't load anything. Really debating deleting it all together.
Social Network
This is it. very fast no crash. :) love the new update. Amazing
Nice this apps
Dope
I even forgot my password because its fallied. It's too to hard
Mine is no workinggg!!!
Paul
Good
Its take too long for the TL to load it takes too long for comments to load it takes too long for friends list to load and pictures. Over this app.
Very Good
Good luck keeping the Facebook app open with the latest update.  If you are lucky, you can scroll through a few posts. But be careful where you touch--get too close to a post and the app will crash.  Stop fixing what isn't broken, and fix what is...THIS APP!
It keeps forcing close,I know you have geniuses there to dream up something to fix it..so please do it and while your at it fix everything else. Talking to you all is like talking to a wall or one of my children
Every time it updates it takes forever for it to load.
I just updated this app & my phone refuses to open Facebook... Wish i could undo the last update....
Pathetic... Its amazing the news/recent feed issue is still present when thy clearly dont care about their users. Not to mention the forced use of messeger.  Uninstall...
Not overly.keen on the layout changes, but I'm sure I'll get used to them
I have no idea what's going on with Facebook app..it keep crashing after few scrolls....its very irritating....i did try to uninstall and reinstall back the app but still the same...please fix this issue...i am using note 2...
Pailako nai thikthiyo baru bujis lade k bujthis ra jhatha taile nepali vasa :)
Best!
To much updates fix it.
Good
Good
Loved it
The new update..It's always forcing me to close the app! Fix it please.
Wid lots of peoples
Improving
Good and me lucky man and thanks for Scott Thomas to make Fb and fbmessenger
Nice
Why do we need to install messenger? Just something that takes up more space than it is worth
It freezes, it takes forever to load, its just a very un-useful app
Better than before.
So awesome I love it
Why must I constantly choose most recent for my feed.  If I wanted to see it the other way, I would choose that way.
Remains a stable app. Really need to re-integrate the messenger app, they stand alone is rather intrusive.
Pretty good
I Love Facebook
Facebook has done it again! The app that keeps getting worse and worse! Noe you want to check your notifications while looking at tour most recent feed? Too bad! Facebook will keep trying to force you to look at the "Top Stories" despite what you may want. Good job Facebook, I keep getting more and more dissatisfied with your product.
Great app...
I am giving this app a low rating because i am having serious issues. I have a samsung galaxy tab 3 and if i scroll the newsfeed everything is ok but once i try to comment on a status, try to click on a pic, try to visit a friends page or anything besides scroll the newsfeed i get kicked off of facebook. I have read online alot of people have same issue. Facebook needs to look into this and fix it. i am ready to uninstall this app.
Opening the app now takes forever and it shuts itself down instantly so it's pretty much useless currently.
Why does it have to update so much?
This app keeps crashing. It worked great until last month.  Now i cant post statuses or go through my news feed without the app crashing. Please fix ASAP
To many update I have to deleted  some photo video or apps to make sure this apps can update my phone don't have enough space for this app memory n=
change it too much
I will not give a better rating until bugs are fixed.  Ever since last update I am unable to use Facebook. I can be scrolling through news feed and it closes, try to make a status and it closes,  try to read comments and it closes. FIX THIS PKEASE!
Takes up way to much space on my phone
I own a Galaxy S3 and it doesn't work smoothly anymore.. It used to, though... Maybe that's due to the new update. I had to remove it
Facebook is very boring it needs more color and emojis for when you update your status its boring and it needs to be faster
Solo se sigue crackiando arreglen esto se traga toda mi memori y es una estupides no poder pasar toda la memoria al sd
Constantly reverting to Top Stories instead of Most Recent, while Most Recent is now tucked away somewhere else, and Messages moved to a separate app. Hate it all.
I really wish there weren't so many permissions.  I also wish we could access our messages without downloading messenger.  Sigh
Nice
Wouldn't load
Bugs have been fixed Works perfect.
Awesome
It is veer cool.
Recent update wont play videos. This app takes up way too much space, plus the messager is now MANDATORY in order to message people?  Why do you need to take up that much space on a phone for such a simple task?  Stop being ignorant Facebook and change things for THE BETTER.
I am really sorry I updated as Facebook have stuffed up newsfeed and I am missing seeing posts. Hate it will look for alternative and hopefully others will to. If people leave Facebook in droves they may take notice.
Too many updates,  takes up too much space
its good
Too many updates occupied more space.
Facebook
Crash all the time
Facebook
New update sucks.. Cant use..wont load..wth
I love this app, it's a great way to keep up with family and friends especially if u live SOOOOOOO far away from the ones u love dearly!!
Big Raw
Gud for use
I like it!!
Good
Facebook
To many changes
Fb why must u update every few weeks? Leave it the way it is n stop f****** it up.... gezzz
Now photos won't load! Something is wrong with every update.  They just keep making it worse than the previous version.
Facebbok needs to fix the app like now im sick of not being able to pst updates not being able to share anything and not being able to stay current with friends i keep getting things from months ago and then the app keeps closing i have a samsung galaxy 3tab and ive called samsung 3 times now they all tell me it is the new facebook update well fix it before i delete the app
..... Banana bandh karo.  logo ko update nahi, Apne mobile me khali space chahiye .... :)
Such a disappointment if its not constantly crashing, its continuously getting larger and larger.. Love Facebook, HATE this app.....
Update,update and another update.......???????
Facebook is not opening in my new micromax canvas knight phone showing  again and again error in connection and not updating regularly pls fix the problem
impossible to open in my cubot x6 since last update, closes automatically while is loading. Fix it please.
Would like notifications of friends' birthdays. I only know that it's someone's bday if I see another friend posted on their wall.
No problem
Very nice to see close friends and relative update
Gave 1 star because you cannot give 0. First of all facebook was forceful and forced us to install one more application for msg. Now this application takes about 65 MB of data just by mere login and keeps updating with nothing changing...
Awesome
What does it mean when feeds are not shown in chronological order even if I've selected Most Recent? It means this app SUCKS. Gonna uninstall it and use Chrome to view my account instead.
Likd it
I dont understand why this FB app. cant go on a SD card especially w/all the space it takes up on a phone. It takes 4 ever 4 EVERYTHING, PICS, NOTIFICATIONS, STATUS UPDATES- i wish it wasnt already on my ph#!!!
Not properly wotking... After sumtym giving an error
This update is retarded nothing is loading no pictures or videos and shows me stuff from 3 days ago as new in news feed fix it
WILL NOT UPDATE UNTIL facebook removes these ridiculously insane permissions!!! Invading the peoples privacy this is unacceptable!!
^_^ Love it!
Good app
Slow loading ! Very poor . disgusting ! And annoying .
Among the best if all the social medias.
Good application but need more improvement in loading newsfeed.. You need good internet connection to make the newsfeed load faster..
Awesome to find old friends and family, but it could also be addicting lol
Luv it
Nice app
Almost all of the links I click on crash before they open
chat
Hi
Now I can get on my FB Jk lol lmao no seriously
Slow, takes up too much space
Continues to say "Error loading News Feed". Thanks POS developers for another crapy update!
No good You suck FB!! Timeline doesnt show recent post no matter how many times I refresh it.
I don't understand what all the updates are for lately when they really don't change anything except for more of my phone space and data so yeah thanks guys I'm sure u got better things to rip us off with
Too much space. :(
After updating to ver.18, facebook always not responding. Kindly fix this.
Latest Update Is Even Worse Doesn't Load And Is Even Slower Than Before
Loves facebook
Lagging problem
Still no option to change whom I share posts with, ie excluding some people or lists., not interested in what people did last week I want to know what is going on now. Ive missed stuff due to this reason.new updated today and,continually freezing then crashing. Thought,point of updated version was to IMPROVE things EXTREMELY UNHAPPY
Locks up, crashes, fails to make posts, won't leaf pictures. It was horrible and somehow is even worse. At one time this was a good app that I enjoyed using, but that was quite some time ago. I'm forced to use the browser now. It sucks, not worth the one star, but negative stars are not an option.
exo kris
Its the most popular social media app and yet they can't get it right. Its always having errors or locking up my phone. Don't even think about sending error reports because they won't do anything.
this app does a good job of displaying Facebook in a manageable way
I hate your new messenger, the old one work great
like
good
jd
best in the world
Good
If a refresh or loading of new stories didn't completely hide or make the story or comment I was going to click on disappear.  The post will be 10 minutes and the pp just loads the new posts by itself and cause the post I wanted to read disappear so I have to search for that persons profile or page to find the story.  Otherwise it is a great app and top notch programming as usual from fb.  Most people just don't understand technology and need to get a house phone and give up on smartphones.
Awesome yaar this is great then last updated app
Junck gay don't even let me sign in
Too many updates. This is really annoying
love it..
This latest update is ridiculous. Runs slow as molasses. Why can't it just take me to the internet for articles like it used to? Now they don't even load. Also, why isn't there a way I can see those posts that I "liked" in a category? Thinking about ditching the app after 5 years because it's just become too much.
connecting games without logging great.
Why Stickers not supporting in my device?  Plz reply. .
I Want A Choice Of different  Facebook  Applications . Some older devices do not function well with the new apps. If you have a new expensive and fast device - then the new modern fancy apps may work fantastically - but - often the devices just become slow , irritating  and  frustrating .
Just updated the app and now it won't even open bc it kills the memory on my phone. I like Facebook but this app just keeps getting worse.
For all the updates this application goes through there should not be lagging problems. It seems to update your feed you must pull down far too many times. Issues liking posts. So not impressed with the quality
Ty
Its amazing how this app gets ruined by updates instead of making it better. Deleting and done with it... Bunch of idiots!!!
It always crash before you could access the App!
Perfect
Too much crap to deal with it's about time for another social media app if face book doesn't change he way they do some stuff..........
Not worth it...
Updated. Slower than ever.
New update doesn't let anything load
I hate Facebook simply because I was forced to download their messenger. I'm deleting my Facebook account.
Need to be fixed
It Was A great way to reach it without having to go to chrome or opening a new window way faster!  Thanks God for apparently
enough with the updates and changes.
This is the biggest app on my phone and it only gets bigger
Newest update lagging like crazy. It keeps getting worse.
More Privacy options
Kamal Jain jalna
"Awsome" :/
Took absolute ages to download & then it was absolutely useless opening has it kept freezing up. I had an older version on my phone prior & i had no problems with that, also i hate the messenger thing that has been added.
Facebook is getting worse with every update
Nice!
Its alway made me angry every time i use it because  always lag and just disappear automatically, so i need to go back again and open it.. I am not satisfied to this app since i use it after being updated, and one thing the messenger i really get mad because why do i have to download it, it will use a huge  space of my ram when i use to open fb..since i using fb i dont use messenger so why now we need to install, its just the, we type message, we send picture, etc with the use of old version.. Haay..
Facebook is 100% trash!
ITS SO GUD.. ;-)
Facebook has been great. But ever since yesterday it closed and I now cant swipe to look at new photos. Only the ones that I clicked on. Help? Or fix the bug (if it is one) thank you!
Oh love it!!!!
I think it could be more technological.
Always update
Facebook keeps closing itself for no reason, can't share, cannot even continue reading an article. This must have something to do with last update. Works on Samsung Galaxy S5, but not Samsung Galaxy Tab3. Just uninstalled this app. Will not work on my tablet , sucks. I am on Facebook all the time.
Still hard to get a problem fixed. Takes a while after you report it. Also don't care for the constant up grades. If it isn't broken, don't break it..You can always up grade your phone.
Needs to be better
Very ni ce
Awesome
It's awesome
This app keeps  crashing
Keeps closing for no reason whatsoever. Impossible to use. What the hell is going on? Why is this so difficult to fix? I uninstalled a number of times and nothing works
Last updated sucks the new links crap is slow and full of bugs
It's OK for now but the application makers don't contact anyone back
Good
Love keeping in contact with my family
Pleaaaaaaaase .. We need copy & paste function and make it available to download it on " sd card " like the messenger application. They're big problems guys :(
Tired of updates!   uggg
Ree  buena
Good
Still have to keep notifications off to conserve battery but the app is much much better than before.
Why cant i change my news feed to most recent
Older version
Won't open the app no more!!!!
Good way to keep in contact.
Maybe stop wanting our information with each update
I loved it very much.
Very nice new version
I would like to see the most recent posts of the day. Not posts from days past
I can't change my group cover pic nd I can't copy status other persons I want copy some time nice quits
Terlalu banyak menggunakan memory telefon
Should have Facebook themes
Slow
Great
Great
My tablet was fast and reliable.  Then I started using Facebook. Now it's so slooooow. Facebook is like malware we chose to use...
Hong limong feitau!
Lately the app just kicks me out when  I just open it, am trying to leave a coment, or loading up a picture. Very annoying!!
update this app. then ill give you shot out please its too old
It makes everything on my phone very slow
Nice
Too many updates & each update includes nothing more.
Facebook is known for data mining. I personally won't use Facebook because they use it for advertising purposes, and selling it to 3rd parties who pay a good sum... Switch to Google plus, it's more cleaner, sleek, and you're data is actually protected more effectively, than what Facebook is doing....
New update sucks. Facebook takes forever to load.
I delete it
This app doesnt work. I can find my friends quickly and i cant message them without downloading another app. Its so slow at sending messages and showing news on my feed. I dont usually see it until 2 days later. This terrible. Uninstall.
Don't like messenger and refuse to install. Stop sending me reminders. App freezes all the time. Won't play videos and stops working when scrolling. Very annoying.
To much interference when I'm trying to read Facebook !! I'm getting fed up with this problems
When i see that one of my friend as commented on a post. If there is lots of comment i need to find his comment. Would be great if when you see "your friend left a comment" you click on it and shows exactly his comment.
Great app
Since updating the app today I cannot open Facebook on my sensation how can I resolve this crappy problems still as bad a complete waste of space
The only issue I have is when I want to see new updates doesn't update well
Perfect
Setting up just a moment make me so fuckin bored for waiting!!!
sight keeps crashing when using it. very annoying. please fix!
After the recent update, its running incredibly slow and its taken up so much memory on my phone, so i'm guessing this is why. Looking through the reviews it turns out an awful lot of people aren't happy either. Thank god I'm not the only one.
Good
Since the last update its not working.. It says setting up Facebook then just a second and then it collapse .. fix the glitch..
It reminds me of 1987 back when you could trust your friend..
It takes a long time to download and my fone new
its ok.
Still needs work but a nice app.
Every update says that you're supposed to be able to post and upload offline. Have not seen it yet...
Needs work
Won't let me upload pics since the update
Tnx
Fun and addicting.
Sick of these updates!! Instead of updating stupid issues that we don't need why not fix the news feed issue, I'm sick of seeing what people have done yesterday!!!
Facebook
Sick of updates, sick of sharing media files of personal things with fb
Facebook cgt bgus..

Father holds up lovingly a son he's proud of.
Facebook
Great apps...
This application really isn't as fast as I'd thought it'd be ya feel me
Starting to get worse with every update!
Working ok on my s4
Love all the games and addicting updates keep up all the hard work and doing what you guys do...
I am still waiting for todays predictions, but yesterdays pretty much told it like it was. I'll have to read todays and  get back to this later. I know already it will be good. Pats still gazen. Later
Love this app
cool
Everytime it updates it overloads my phone memory. This is an everyday thing, please stop the madness.
Awesome
Someone hacked my fb now I can't get into my site even with new passwords. I'm VERY upset.
No use complaning, Facebook could care less as long as the money train keeps rolling.
find old friends & new ones
Download
Had to change password because it said it was wrong. Got in once then told me wrong password again. Changed again, same results. Sent email, no response.
I found this useful at the start, but weeks later I couldn't post any updates, it doesn't load for ages, it doesn't let me "like" or reply to any comments. It works sometimes if I'm lucky. Then similar issues happen everytime it finished updating, how ironic is that? Update so we can get more Facebook problem or update to improve? We're all confused, and most of the feedback here are negative. I'm not surprised! Will u fix them? How long do we have to wait? Maybe..forever? lol..
When I first got the app it was great. I've had it for a month now and now it keeps shutting down on my Samsung galaxy s5. It did the same thing on my last phone and I thought it was just the phone. Please fix. This is ridiculous.
Its FB everything and more
It controls you more than you control it. So tired of it now. Liked it better in the beginning. Just keeps getting worse.
My facebook keeps booting me out randomly on my Samsung notebook
Cannot play video. Sorry, there was an unknown error while playing this video.
Very disappointed facebook is doing horrible
Freezes a lot, hard to get it working again without rebooting the tablet wholesale. Other than that, its an acceptable solution to getting on FB.
Really really bad app .
Crashes regularly on samsung tab3
I love facebook

Force closes all the time! Quit updating! Fix it and make one that works and leave it!
Love it
THIS IS NO1 APP IN THE WORLD
If you think your updates is making people happy, then let me tell you, you are so wrong.  These updates are taking so much space, not making fb app any better and if it is better, then its barely.
Best software
Good on samsung
Bn
Amazing tanks mark sir love you all world
Phone keeps freezing since latest updates
Wont even let me open at all since update...
I loved it!
"Face book setting updating" ?????
Love it
amazing
Crashes on Galaxy tab everytime I open it.
Gud job creators.with the new update its awesum
The app takes up too much space. It is very slow laggy in a piece of crap get this thing fixed maybe I'll reinstall.
Kicks me out when i try to access my friends or the help button
I don't want or need fb reading my text messages.
It sucks!!!
Awesome app for samsung galaxy s 5
Could use more vidio content
Security
My favourite app
Lately every time I open this app, it cuts off and restarts my tablet. This is very annoying, and this began after the last update.  Please fix this because I have no problem with any other app. If not I'll just uninstall the app. What's the point in updating something when it's going to be troublesome.  Right now this app is very frustrating,  fix this Facebook
The newsfeed does not populate by most recent. I have to go to most recent and then still miss posts!!! I can be in the middle of going through it and it will populate with something that I should have seen two days ago!!!! ALSO, why does it unlike posts that you know you have liked?????
Just a good app
Any chance of fixing your slow,laggy and unresponsive app????? Its been total rubbish the past few weeks!!
Okay I love Facebook. I go on it everyday, but it could be nice if there were different themes for Facebook. I can't stand looking at the same thing everyday. But other than that its a good app.
I love how people want to hate on Facebook for putting out updates or anything else when we all know it has changed our social lives for the better!!!!! Most couldn't live without it!!!! Amen to you Mark zuckerberg or however its spelled!!!! Keep up the great!!!! Work!!!!!
I would have expected a much better app from such a large company.
On timeline tab, please add sort newsfeed by most recent update not from profile tab.
Horrible this app crashes my phone. I had to uninstall.
GREAT APP
Benchoddd
It seems like every time I update facebook I have another problem it takes up more space and now the issue I am having on my cell phone and my tablet Facebook will not sync my contacts it seems to be more problems than its worth if this is not fixed by me sending them the report in a few days I am deleting Facebook all together on my mobile devices
So much space taken up for same old Facebook phew....
But it crashes bad on my fon fix and youll get those 5 stars
I've limited this app as much as possible without disabling it or uninstalling it.  It still takes up a lot of memory and drains my battery.
Es muy eficz, pero arruina la vida de las persona.
Bull that you have to give all access to your phone
I like this
SLOW
Takes up too much memory and not seeing point of updates
Just good
its so nice
More updates and its still working, feel strange saying this but well done facebook... better not have spoken too soon!
I loved it
Updates too often, they removed the messaging feature.
Esta bien la app para Cel pero para tabletas le falta muchisimo
Will not let me post or share
Great app
None of your updates improve the app for me. Please stop putting "top stories" instead of most recent-they're not top stories to me. Each update crashes more frequently. The app seems to get slower. Can I get Facebook Circa 2010??
Yes
Good app
Google+ there yet?
awesome
up up
The new update keeps on crashing. It makes me sick. Please fix this!!
We don't want the new messenger for messages...go back please...NOW!!!! THANK U
Goood
This app updated on my tablet and it is horrible. It freezes and shuts down every single time I try to use it. You can't scroll your newsfeed, comment on other posts, post on your own page or upload photos or videos without the app completely closing over and over. For an app that takes up so much space it is ridiculously buggy and inefficient. On top of that it demands that you give it too many permissions.  Do yourselves a favor. Don't download this app. Log on to your account on the web instead. Less permissions needed and it doesn't crash that way. Facebook isn't worth rendering you mobile device unusable and wasting space. 9/22/2014. This stupid app updated on my tablet. I have no way to stop automatic Facebook updates now, and guess what, you idiots still have not fixed the problems. Your app is worse and worse and I will never put it on my phone. I can sign in just fine from the web, losers. October 2nd 2014. Another update, the app still doesn't work. I check back every time this stupid app updates. It still doesn't work, wich is why I won't ever recommend it or install it on another device.
What happened to the good old days. You shared a conversation face to face.
Turning notification off is not working in this update and the one before :(
I want the reply feature!
I agree update EVERY week smh
Destroys battery
the facebook keeps kiking me out
Newsfeed never updates. Content from 3 days previous or worse
Wooooooiooooooooooooiioohoooooooooooooooo
Cant load anything on the new update!
All my news articles I try to click on makes the app force close! So frustrating!
Thnxx for the update
Best ever
It wont download. Gets to 93% and says downloaded but says installing. And wont open.
Just a real live one,trying to make it easier for me...
When posting pictures,  I'd like to go into my gallery folders instead of scrolling through my whole camera roll. That crashes the app.
i love this aplction
Every time I look it's more updates it's taking to much space on my phone that is not good
I love star
Updates too often and too big. Battery life suffers as well as RAM
Super king
What happened to the option to view links within the app? Annoyingly takes me back to the top of my newsfeed every time I click a link?
Would love it if the news feed was in most recent order, not what FB deems popular.
To many large updates which do not improve the app, it only results in even less privacy and control
Cover page is not full in potrait mod
Facebook is starting to get boring.  Considering deleting the app. At first it was fun and interesting but now it just lost it touch. I like Twitter better.
This app constantly shuts down on me, please fix.
Newer versions just eat too much space
....
Facebook
Good hhhhhhhhbfei
Nice helpful and entertaining
So hard to find my new uploaded picture! I can't refresh it! Can you put a refresh button on the album after the uploading so that I can see it!? Thanks!
<3
I wanna open the link that people post on fb but I can't. I have try to use chrome and default browser, none of it works. So that I have to restart my phone to open the link. Annoying!!!!
Its a phone not a supercomputer.
I'm tired of top news showing first! I don't care about top news!
I am going to give it a 5star rating it works good
FB can't be move to sd card anymore?
Fix some bugs and improve speed
Uk o roaring
When I have this ap, my phone is struggling to live. When I uninstall it, my phone is healthy.
Excellent
Google
No me gusta porque no es divertido y es muy feo, tambien no juego los deberes.
I cant see any images
Good update
This version keeps crashing on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.
Shan
Navigation could be better. I hate how the current posts are hidden all the way to the left under groups and settings.
Thank god for smart phones so Fk installing this always updating app the brings nothing but headaches like this last one it shuts down after opening it.  Hope you can tell when someone uninstalls it cuss here I go... bye!    FIX IT.
Twitter will soon do what we want Facebook to do. Then watch everyone leave...
Boor app
Facebook can't open again after updated it. Fix
Should leave alone. Found a better alternative, FriendCaster. Seems to be better.
Yeah cool
I love this for thats feture.
Overall okay
Too big
Too much space for ram!!!!!!!!!
Posting to wall message not working. I still need to go to their walls to post.
Installed Facebook as an app so many times and uninstalled because its so slow plus when i log out it keeps kicking me back in then it tells me im already logged out but still insists on trying to throw me back in then decides im logged out then it starts again and im sat waiting 20 mins before anything happens i hate this app so much its just a fookin waste of my time i won't be installing it again ever! it even takes less time through Google and that is shite!
It is not properly working in my samsang galaxy star? Why?
Everytime you try to comment, share, or even look at a photo the app closes.
Lepsi
I love facebook but i noticed why did messages get moved to messenger though
Hot Scottie
This application is slow running and stop rapidly on my smartphone samsung galaxy s duos gt-s7562
Okay, here's the deal Facebook. I'm not downloading Facebook Messenger, plain and simple. I've seen the news and what comes with the price of downloading your useless app, and I'm not interested. So, stop trying to enforce people on getting the app. You constantly with the 'Get App' button is honestly annoying, and makes me feel harassed. If I wanted to download the Messenger app, don't you think I would've done so? But I haven't, so get rid of it, or risk the fact that you're going to loose another account
This app updates weekly and i dont see any changes. Its taking up so much memory on my phone and its not worth.fix this. Its so annoying
every time I open the facebook  closed .. and crashed.. fix that please
I Like it .
Layout and functionality is okay... News feed "Most recent" is too hard to find and when selected doesn't sort by most recent.. I couldn't care less about "Top News". Also, what's the point of the friends list being in random order! Were people complaining about ABC order being too easy??! Same goes with friend finder, should be in descending ABC order by number of mutual friends! These seem obvious to me but Facebook appears to have deliberately made changes to make app harder to use on a daily basis.
It works good now
Cooooooool
Tired of having to go to most recent to see the newest posts only to see things from last week because someone recently made a comment.  I only want to see the new stuff, not stuff from the previous month.  No joke, a friend's parents were on my most recent feed, even though they died two years ago.  All because someone made a comment.
Mesenger pffff
5 star...
Great app just love it use it all the time.
Grandmother
Glitches galore
Uses too much memory
Every time I restart my tablet it auto logs me out, why is that,  its getting annoying,  my cell doesn't do that . Please fix the problem, I got the Samsung Galaxy Discover and Samsung galaxy tab 3 lite
Ladna hassan
No longer able to sync photos and sick of having to reset to recent in my feed horrible set up wish I could go back a version!
I can not read all the posts on  news feed, it resets to the beginning 1 minute in..  pretty lame..  Facebook = new MySpace..  look up ELLO, think this is gonna be a lot better..
So the application crashes when opening.  Did they even try it before released it? Hellooooooo.
Every time I open the app I have to sort by most recent. Now I'm finding that even if I do sort by most recent, I don't get all updates. If I do linger on the normal top stories news feed for a moment I notice theres updates from hours ago that did not appear on my most recent feed. It's such a shame this app fails at something so simple, yet your Facebook messenger app is one of the best out there. Please fix this, we want to see everything in our news feed as it happens!
So so...!
You guys are doing great job.
I hate the fact that i have to download the messenger app just to pm my family or friends. I dont want fb to have that kind of access to my personal info...it can turn on my camera and access all my texts and contacts. Its none of your business who i know outside of fb or what i do at home. Put the messaging back with my fb page and not another app and i will keep my fb account.
Hi
The good thing is that the UI looks sleek which is nice, and its a lot better than before. Forcing people to use messenger as a replacement is unnecessary. Just because it's permissions allow them to violate your privacy even more! Look at the permissions before you install!
Sering banget pembaharuan..banyak banget pake memory bikin berat hp..dipersimpel n dperingan ajj lah..
I always check the reviews before updating.  Currently have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and will upgrade soon to a 5. Lately Google+ is looking much better. Less space used and it works without hesitation. Need to step it up fb. I'm already working on getting my friends to switch. They don't like the space it requires and their batteries dying so quickly either. Please get it together FB. I really do like FB concept just not the sacrifices.
Now, this is starting to look like something coming from popular social media.
No messenger!
Update increased speed my ass it did. Getting sick of this constant update shit that makes it worse! If you aren't going to improve it leave it the fuck alone!
BRING BACK FB MESSAGES!! SERIOUSLY THE STUPIDEST THING YAL DID BY GETTING RID OF IT!! And the news feed sucks I only wanna see daily stuff not stuff from two or three days ago!!
The only difference between app & its usual web function is that I couldn't @tag friends who are in a group page when i use app installed in my sp ...
grt app
The update stay way to long
I don't like being forced to install a separate app for chatting.
To many updates and not enough of the app actually working
Anu nangyari bkit nag eerror na sya
This thing sucks
It's ite!!!
Please this application need serious improvements, any time u refresh you see old post for as old as 4 to 5 days pls do something.
Facebook app is the best comunication ,W/ the Friends and Family very good
Could do with more
Nice
Good
My
4 stars when it works. 1 star when it just doesn't move. This app needs a lot of connection speed fixes. Using the internet browser is so much faster to use.
Assaker
Ta very Much!
Awesome
I can't change my newsfeed to  show recent posts. I don't give a stuff about top stories! I f it ain't broke don't fix it!!  7/5/2014 and now it's constantly crashing my phone!!  2/10/2014 please give us back 'stop notifications'
I really love the updates especially tonight's which caused a blank screen and corrupted everything . I just loved having to wipe everything and do a recovery.
The fact that it takes up a boat load of my memory space really has me considering if I should have it on my cel phone. Too many updates take up memory space.  Not good when you would like to download other apps as well.  
The app itself works fine and doesn't crash, but since a recent update push notifications don't work. I no longer get any form of notification so it's pointless now.
Very good
Nice
This app is frustrating. It only shows top news rather than most recent. I can't share to my page from here anymore. It's constantly unresponsive and glitchy
All the permissions this app needs...
I
Please leave my Facebook log it the same as it was .My log in was debbie59.I really need it so that I can remember it.Please answer this ASAP.
I like facebook because I like to chat with my friends and family
App lags to much
No privacy
U need access to my microphone now for messages and u took over my browser? F**k you zuckerburg
Lovely
I love u world
App crash every second on   my device running Androidm 4.2.2
Doesn't seem to get better. Updates are useless and it takes too much space.
It crashes all the time videos never seem to work unless you have full signal. Now I have updated it 3 or 4 times now and nothing is new or changed. Or my fav I open fb or a page or pic or about any thing and it just closes and you have to open it and start over. What the hell!!!!!!!!!
Way too many updates.  Uses too much space and doesn't need all this private info that it needs special permission for. Completely unnecessary and invasive.
Love my facebook
I can not play my games, that I have on facebook
LOL
Nice nice
I am pleased with what it delivers, it suits my need admirably, so much belly aching, yeeeesssshhh
updates constantly and works when it feels like it, not when I want it.. make it simpler it eats all resources on less powerfull phones
Back this again to the old Facebook because i can't save photo in this 
I stay on it!!
Love it!
Won't work after new update
Tired of app insisting I sync all my other apps. Only use it to keep in contact with friends and family. If I want to share my info, I'll do it at my own leisure.  Let the user decide, don't force it.
I hate that you have to down load a fb messenger to talk to friends i tried it & my phone had nothing but problems ! I uninstalled it & refuse to get it back i can live without fb !
I like it
Great app!
Drained 33% of battery in 4 hours yesterday. Uninstalled.
Ido'tlike
Loving it
It works, but its getting too big and too slow for a mobile app. Needs some serious trimming.
You spend too much time sending things between friends that we never sent. It is unerving how you disregard our privacy and our choices for your amusement. If you just leave us alone to use it on our own it would be an awesome app!
It stop at the beginning. Then it will not totally open
Updates too much
Pain in da behind
when i want to post a photo in comment...i must select a photo from all the album...i need to select a photo from my Gallery because that an easy way.& the other problem that your app. is a memory killer !
Dorante
People connect to you all over north america
Doesn't work on my phone. Did before not now.
Keep up the great work!
i see the news feed is the yesterday  and the latest are i will see it tommorow.
Ok
Es una web estupenda para mantenerme en contacto con mis amigos de todas partes, sencillamente nos mantiene cerca....
Takes up too much space, lags, no recent news feed, clogs up my ram, need I go on.... and the updates NEVER fix anything.
Ty
Facebook is part of my life
Crashes on Samsung tab 3
My life story easily shared, just binned my diary
uses too much space on device. not all the users have infinite internal memory...
Very Gud
Just awesome
l hate that we have to download messenger.
I cannot download this app.
The best social media app.
No respect for MOBILE USERS! Nearly daily 25mb updates for poorer quality.  :-(
This update sucks, keeps freezing and crashing
The title says it all
Love it
Works for me!
U
Good communicative messenger
Itss nw easy to access n use
News feed won't show most recent first. Disabling notifications does not work in app.
I downloaded it and gets stuck installinng or setting up, it's the third time I do this and I can't get it to work
Facebook is good but ever since I have updated it it won't let me go on it when I click on app to go on it it goes off
Well cool
Ggg
Magic new phone 
Facebook app takes up too much space on my phone and uses up too much data and the reason I log off the app on my phone every day.
I wish the Facebook disappeared.
Video does not works
Its time to give this garbage up the updates are ridiculus and you force people to utilize additional apps and features this sucks
Very bad and so slow
Activate account. Deactivate account. Activate. Deactivate. Activate. Deact..
It's Like So Cool
Too much space i like music more than facebook so fix this some how
Don't care
Sn
Takes up tons of space and constantly updates.
This app it the most space consuming app on my phone even if I don't use it too much or after clearing the data of app.....please fix this
App is too big, and over bearing, in keeping with Facebook philosophy.
Stop updating so much and test on popular devices before releasing the update. Can't get past setting up Facebook screen, Samsung galaxy s3
I am so close to uninstalling and even going back to MySpace.  The privacy permission is ridiculous,  now its mandatory to have messenger app too or can't send/receive messages.  There is no user control fb makes you see/do what they want. Ie; default feed is whats popular,  idgaf I want the right to choose what I want to see. Facebook I shame you!
Weak
Murugan
I just updated again abs it won't load and when it does get close it folks up my memory and shutdown my phone usage!! Really guys!!????
Can't view groups or liked pages, very frustrating. Every time I click on a liked page or a group the page will go blank then after a while I get a message that Facebook is not responding. I then have to close it down and start again. I have also noticed lately when I click on Most recent folder I only get a few recent posts then it goes back several hours then previous days! Another update and you're still not fixing the issues being reported here!!!
Good
Nivr
Nic
Why am I forced to sync my calendar and share all this information with facebook? Can I get the older version back?!?
Photos nt loading
Cool to me , if im careful
It's constantly freezing up. I send at least 3-4 reports daily. Please fix this otherwise I'll just go back to the mobile version, which works much better
Awsome
Help please i cant use my act on face book. Nother person i found my acts cant get texts code as my number being use. Help thk u
Grateful to have more options available. Stinks though to HAVE to use a separate message app.
Typical poor programming.
your fb mobile is going to be worst and worst every time it had an update.... please fix all the problems before you give us an update!
Is 2 good
The app takes a lot of my phone memory
I like facebook
Really disappointed that .GIF moving pictures are not supported! I mean c'mon! You have videos that move on their own. and for the messenger... Stupid!
always setting up & thn it get close fix it
Ever since the last update my galaxy nexus 5 has been having intermittent issues where upon launching the app nothing responds. Only temporary fix is a restart of the phone, which fixes issue for a while. Please address to change rating.    Update 9/29/14: still having issues with app. Considering uninstalling at this point.   Update 10/2/14: latest update looks like the resolution is completely off, sorry guys you just lost me.
The app is useless in all senses possible. Its huge on the memory storage. Takes up a lot of ram. And is the most recurring  app in background service. I mean it literally runs 24x7 in the background taking up almost 40-48 mbs of ram. Adding to this is the compulsory messenger app (widout which u cannot chat) also heavy on storage and almost 30 mbs of ram in background and i always find both of them running in background all the time. Zuckerberg what are you indeed trying to prove. Make it firendly on fone.
its always "setting up facebook",or "just a moment"
After i updated it . it keeps showing "setting up Facebook" , then it shows "just a moment" , then it closes , i cant use it .
The one
Can't add pictures to my group via the app it just freezes
Nice application
Buenisima actualizacion
I don't like that you have to go into settings to change to most recent every time you open the app and even then it isn't always the most recent that it actually shows (in my experience anyway)
Didn't want to install an app so big and unreliable that requires so much access to my phone. But FB seem to have deliberately faffed up the mobile web site. Not on
Tk dapst d baca
Hate this update have uninstalled fb as just shuts all the time!!!
Worse and worse! FEDbook is an NSA Shadow Intelligence Contractor and  downloads 5tbs of its end users photos a day using facial recognition software. Whenever the app's bot technologies detects a shield name or phrase like the Koch brothers owning most of the fertilizer plants, the app causes the controls to pop uo at the bottom to make you accidentally logout or report a good post as spam. WARNING: FB White House page is implanting backdoor software in your computer. Will cause text to scramble.
Since it did an update today, it has been slower than ever. Locking up and shutting down. Enough with the updates, it only messes things up. Fix the crashes and lockups please!
Since u updated it,it became worse..always not responding!!
It first is excellent.
Ok
Even photos not saving. Showing error.
Most recent stories are gone from main view.. you have to access them through a weird panel on the right!
Jzt amazing..... Love it.
I tired of other people using my name for there Facebook profile.
Facebook
Loving it
Maybe too much. We'll see
Won't let me get onto my facebook.... Please sort it out
Facebooc kadija muhammed
There is no option to adjust font size. Please add this option. Twitter app has it!!
I cant ever use it on my galaxy tab 3. Everytime i open app it stays open for around a minute then it closes or if i go to a friends page itll close. Please fix.
When ever  I touch the Facebook app, It goes to the play store Google apps, instead of Facebook website
Room for improvement
Slow too slow
I like app
Good app
Pls fix dis app cover more ram then comparison with other high end app
BEST APP EVER!
Very good application but we have to use much space in order to download it..this is because of these many updates
Yet again, the video player STILL doesn't work on my Excite.
Why have the mgs button there and you still need the messenger app
Facebook app sucks it won't load up then when it does facebook not responding comes up and goes back to the main screen! Deleted
Ang Ganda xD
Nonesense Constant network error.
Is it me or are you making this bloated mess slower and slower. Takes up a lot of space and still works at a pace turtles would be ashamed of.
This new update made the app unusable. It force closes upon opening the app after 2 seconds. Its like coding in the app was deleted.
This is very nice application for chatting and audio calling. I like because call voice is clear and uploading status and file is easy...
Afzalg
Five short words are not good enough for us to determine why we should update.  It doesn't have to be elaborate, but, enough info on what is changing and why we need to update.
After latest update I am not able to upload multiple photos. Please fix it soon
One day facebook will eat all of my memory and all of my apps will be erased.
it is setting up about 1 min and it says the app has stopped working fix this ....!!!!
Don't really care for updates nor messanger takes up alot of space in my phone ehh three stars is all it'll ever be inless you fix it.
Always freezes up on me and wont let me upload pictures.
The recent update sucks. Always crashes and forced closes. Errrrgghh I don't even want to give a single star.  Just coz of the fact...that I'm forced to select atleast a star to submit this request.....I gave you one. Otherwise a Big ZERO for this recent update
I downloaded facebook mobile. It worked fine. Bout a week later it told me i needed to update the app for better facebook mobile expirences. So i did. I updated it and then it force closed everytime i logged in. It refussed to work after update. Im redownloading it. But untile yall fix the problem i wont give a 5 star rating
This app is actually WORSE than not being able to access Facebook. Most recent update causes my HTC M8 to reboot when scrolling past embedded video. I didn't even think Android made that possible, but the Facebook app is terrible enough to do it.
Most recent tab is back. U have to go through settings, but is there again at least.    Not giving all stars though because its still a pain to find the "recent post"
User friendly
I love reading about anyway I can at least tell people how I feel an I can see how everyone else is doing.
Please make it an option, as well as to remove the "online" status from Facebook, but to remove the "last seen" option too...it keeps causing unnecessary arguments, especially because half the time it claims I was online when I wasn't.
Fed up with it

How to download video on my fone..
Be right black! You stay white here!
Nice but msg not working

I have to force the application to close through my task manager, rather than just backing out of it like before. Battery suck galore.
After a while of using this app the pictures dont load and the videos dont play...
Shakes
No privaxy
When I try to put my feeling or im watching.  Then click the movie. It goes right back and asks me what im doing and wont let me post
App constantly shut down when posting a status or viewing friends page
Can't see my location in status
New update made this app unusable. I can't upload photos or access any Facebook groups I'm a member of.
Every update kills my phone memory. I hope this app could be transfered to SD card.
Great app love Facebook but every 1 does ;)
Pls do somethin

Every time I open facebook, it crashes. It's the only app that does this and I have been unable to check my Facebook for a couple of days now. It's getting ridiculous.  I don't understand why every other app is fine but this one closes not even 30 seconds after I open it. It's really annoying and frustrating. Please fix

Getting fed up of Facebook crashing on my Note 3. Seems to be no pattern to it. Its been happening since an update about 6 weeks ago. All other apps are fine. Sometimes get as much as 5 minutes before it closes and restarts. Not good! :(

Even regularly cleaning my internal memory with CM security app this continues to be an app that constantly needs updating and doesnt run as smooth as it promises have had to uninstall then reinstall numerous times frustrating when other larger apps run smoothly :-(
Not working after update
Facebook
Laggy, resource hog, ages since nothing new has been added
Slow loading up upon each use after latest update.
Newsfeed is horrible and you cannot permanently select most recent. Loads of links now won't work. I still struggle to tag anyone in a post sometimes! This app has gone massively backwards!! Just change it back, it's awful!! Now the app freezes and the only way to use the app again is to restart my phone. Everything else carries on working ok, it's just this crappy app that fails nearly every time I use it. The latest updates have made no difference to this either!
GREAT
Facebook is my #1 media connection with friends!

Getting so fed up with Facebook, why can't you just keep it simple?
I need Facebook messenger
To much useless info like unwanted guests
All this update n i cant even watch a  friend video on this plus it taking up memory on my phone
Is good
366666
If i could give this zero stars i would it slows my phone down. Plus why does this app have to know everything that is in your phone?
I don't understand why we have to go to our friend list to click on to a friend's  Facebook page, so we can leave them a message, It would be easier to go straight to their page by simply touching their picture. I have 300 friends and its hard to find one person. On my LG Optimus L9, I no longer have the option to type in the person's name at the top of my friends list. It's simply not there.
Taking up space now my phone is slow as hell. Stop being so goddamned nosy trying to get all of our information. Your app sucks so bad I updated and now it doesn't work at all. Forget Facebook, next trending social network, please. Ever since you all FORCED us to get the messenger app Facebook has been having all these bugs, freezing and stuff. Suckers.
Good update. wheres the option to move pictures to a different album and keep the comments? Notifications need to be better. And I want to be able to see who shared my statuses and pictures
Too many spam adds. And after blocking some adds or advertisers I still see the same exact thing I blocked.news feed not updating right.I posted something and went to delete but delete was not showing up. I also notice I post something I go back later a couple days to see it on my wall and it's not there anymore for example I check in at my mechanic so I would know what day I got my car fix months later I go to see what day it was but post is no longer on my wall.
Its an ok app but the web is better i think
E Ravish
Very nice
App works great but I want recent to be my main news feed
I love that I was able to get in touch with my long lost family and friends...it becomes bad when after adding u, they start becoming strangers again :( now, why bother?
Wow that's great to use Fb its good and fantastic. But one problem it was very slow so pleaseeeeeeeeeee fix this problem snd add more options& reality in my Samsung galaxy y duos lite 2.3.6.
Why my playstore is not working ryt now. Too slow ang suddenly its become an error to download...why?
U keep on update it all over again  gosh that sucks
Good app
My Thang
On a new phone and thanks to this app I already have little to no memory left on my phone. Add the retarded messenger app and its crappier...
B-)
Sweet Jesus, you guys at FB actually hate your users, don't you? Stop pushing top news. If I wanted to read about relevant stuff from a day ago, I'd... Well hell, I've already read about it. Yesterday. You've actively hidden "most recent" feeds. This is total nonsense. Facebook is increasingly intolerable with every update.  Stop it. You guys are terrible.
so slow
Fake app
Loved it
Way too man permissions required
Always a day behind on news wall sometimes even longer before I get notifications, really needs fixing I guess if I were to receive notice about a family member being hurt or dying I wouldn't know unless they were already home from the hospital or already buried, really y'all can do a lot better!!
Will rate 5 when they dramatically drop the amount of space taken

This app is too much of everything. The app is a big file which takes a lot of memory, this app also takes too many side apps (messenger) and is always a battery killer. It would be easier if the app was capable of going to SD card. Then there is the "Updates" nothing happens with these updates that happen 3-4 times a day.
I dont want to install fuc.... messanger! I cant see messages if i dont install messanger. I delete thiss app and back to the browser
Google+ is better :p

Niceee

Like app using
No problems so far.

Its great
One of the worst versions in terms of performance. Huge startup time on Nexus4, big lag time when returning from browser. Completely disappointed.
Since i updated facebook. I am not able to log out my facebook ID. Please fix this bug.

I have a samsung s4. I have had no issues with this app. Updates quickly and works straight away.
Please bring back the native messenger.
So I updated the app today and now I cant log in! Please fix this issue!!!!!
Lose it to much@ have to update too much I'm 72 yrs old can't do it
Too many updates
I like it because it helps me to get to know about other people around
New update sucks no option to remove new icons.  I don't need 2 camera apps nor do I need a Facebook messager icon. Also this app makes wakelocks
superb
Facebook is really good
nice
It turns on when it wants to. I'v had to uninstall and reinstall a few time.
I am not a techy, I hope updating helps just seems like I do this too often.
Just loved the update . Thanks for the debugging !!! But the app makes more memory. Reduce its size.
Qooooooool cooooool soooooool
Nothing in their 'what's new' list is a new feature. Amazing how casual they are about feeding their users a bunch of bullshit.
Definitely better than before
Itz Nice but it don't send videos
Not a very happy person right now. How long does it take for you to fix the  crashing issue?????  Tired of it crashing n telling me Facebook isn't responding. So over it! Also, it would be nice if we could put it on our sd cards. It's a really big file. N takes up a lot of space.
Nice place to contact each other even I found my old school friend after 15 years.thanks to fb
A conglomerate of selected stories from family friends and coworkers for protective services and triumphant sources for location
Everything was okay until I uninstalled Messenger. Once that happened, the freezing, the shutting off, my phone resets. What happened?
Good app
Why do I need a separate app for messages don't make sense.  I dnt like the way the messenger shows Up on ur phone everyonne has to know I hv messages
Amazing
I love this app
I want to see posts in the order that they were posted not in whatever order facebook decides. Half decent version of the app turned into an unusable mess once again. FIX IT!
Every time I open the app, it takes FOREVER to load stories. Also, it notifies me of things, 30 minutes to an hour after someone comments on my status or tag me in something.
I am not a fan of all the permissions
Too many updates and big size

Love it !
As the title says. Videos won't play. No vines, YouTube, or hotlinked videos from other websites. LG G2 4.4.4
Awesome App :)
The app makes my phone super slow plus uses so much memory, and its rare a moment i can just open and use because not even that simple action its possible.
It boils down to 2 things.  Stability and speed.  That UI before was all cool and simple which makes fb a user friendly site.  Now,  it gets worse.  Its too slow due to a huge array of useless changes. I guess thats y instagram is gaining more popularity lately coz of the friendly UI plus they focus more on providing stability and speed on thier every update.  Which is not that often,  proving that their app is greater.

Hiding Recent Stories option for Timeline/News Feed is a big play for advertising.  Really sucks.  Using web view now. --1
They know your every move.
But needs much more things...!!
Same app as always basically.  Should add new features to it though.  Still boring with no layout availability or change in the basic app structure.  Not to fond of the privacy settings for mobile either.

Its alway shows just now and keep on sending me notifications again n again
Cool
I loved facebook
Why all this separate icones? Very poor thinking. Why do you set the location automatically on the message? Stop forcing people
To many updates and It's now taken up to much space
Truly  good apps we get old friends
Found that the app is reporting attributes of my data that never interacted with the actual app. Furthermore this data is going to anonymous servers that aren't Facebook's. Would love to have some experienced security experts tell me what is actually happening
Its good it should get a new look
Can't live without it

This app updates every week and it's not any better
Worth downloading
Works better smoothly without any bug 
Facebook has become a place for idiotic behavior that is some how trendy.  On the flip side it can bring together a community to deal with important issues.  It's all in how you use it.
use to be good know sucks
So nice
Hyyyyyyyy
This app has turned into a space hog that wants too many permissions. Not even Sprint wants that much info off my phone! And this most recent update? Please, it won't update posts for HOURS! There's a reason I use Twitter most of the time, and this just helps to further justify the switch to Twitter and the anticipation for the release of the anti-facebook social media site.

It SUXS that your now forced to download an additional app to read your fb messages.  Can U please allow the messages to be read within f? I don't think it's fair to force us to download another app to our ph. We should be able to choose which apps to download to our phs. Please fix!!!

Crashing almost constantly.. The comments on pages are duplicated, doesn't let me set it to most recent.. I have to manually change my feed every single time. I never write app reviews... But for a company whose entire existence depends on whoring out my data and everyone else's... you sure seem dead set on making people uninstall. All these comments about the same issues and nothing changes? Get it fixed already.

Always updates but always creates more issues this is garbage.
I remember when this first came out for Android. It was crap, the the next couple updates made it even worse. Now, is actually usable. They listened to the users kinda.
Nice Now
Slow
I have a high quality camera on my phone and when I upload pictures that are HD, they turn out blurry and pixelated. I hope you can fix this.
I finally got it to update but it continues to tell me its setting up and will not let me even log in.
It can be better
Too much SPAM advertising, no way to remove "SUGGESTED" posts!

I want that notification toolbar back...otherwise it's very good..
Okay
Videos are not wanting to play..
That is one of the most terribly built apps there on play store. First of all it takes a lot of space for data which is simply unnecessary. Secondly if you kill it and enable it again you have to wait while it configures itself and when it does that it still operates slowly it is simply unjustifiable, when you use so much phone space, you could at least use that data you save for optimizing performance. An undergraduate student could create better app than this. Shame on you facebook!
It consume all of my phone memory.
Still don't like the fact that we are forced to use the messenger app.

Bad usability
Aaa
Super
Many time's while browsing,  the app gets close automatic. Please look into this and update.  I am using ICS on Moto Razr XT910.
Please fix this app. The screen freezes and stays frozen for several minutes. Yesterday I couldn't like posts or statuses and would get an error message that it was abusive or unallowed. UPDATE: I uninstall and then reinstalled the app. It then updated not once, but twice. Now I'm having trouble leaving comments on my own posts as well as having the app freeze.
Really bad its getting worse

I no longer want to comment on anything, unless I want a notification from every other person who also comments on a post... "turn off notifications" and individual posts has never worked.
Absolutely furious that I am being forced to download a separate app that takes up even more memory and data than the original app already requires, only to check messages. Are you kidding me with this bs? Talk about talking advantage of your users.
"Links open faster in FB?" Have you all lost your minds? YOU'RE NOT A WEB BROWSER, YOU'RE A WEBSITE. I've put up with this new "feature" for two days and now uninstalled this garbage application, again. Stop messing with your users! We don't want all of this random crap. Links DO NOT open faster with FB, you are NOT faster then Chrome. Quit already with the identity crisis and CHOOSE TO BE A SOCIAL WEBSITE. Please and thank you.
Well played.
Its way better than before, it its not perfect but they are putting efforts into the app ## they finally listened to us!!!! We can save pics now!!!
Connecting friends so sweet
This app is good if you have 2gb or more ram. Works good and I like the new interface

Not bad. But I'm staying with Google+!

Takes up to much space and every time i try to get on it it keeps forcing closed and takes forever to pull back up does it over and over
Sooo disgusting.. I unfortunately downloaded the updates and hell.. The problems started...
Since the new update I can no longer scroll trough photos in an album.  I can look at one photo but no longer have the option to look at the next one.  Need to click back and then click on the album title and click each photo individually.  Very time consuming and very annoying.

Getting crased.after updated

This sucks that it auto updates, and u can't do anything about it. It is so slow now and the app always shuts down when I'm using It. The latest update was a bad idea. It worked so perfect, before but now it takes a long time to switch between name searches and looking at different pages. Needs a lot of work . But in the end it is still my favorite app, I just wished it would go back to the way it used to work.

Hell...error
Dhaasoo hai bhai
Poop
Very Good
Awsum I Love It. .
Best app
Good
Its very slow when I use sometimes
Has no recent news feed when watching a video it freezes and shuts down it terrible and you smell like toenails
Its awesm
It is not opening my id always an error shows at my tabs screen incorrect email adress I know that my email adress is correct plz fix this problem
This update has been the best so far. I was fedup of the slow app on my 2G connection and reload msgs. The update has made the loading really fast and photo loading has also been improved to a great extent. The photos load almost instantly now.
Awesome
Everything is great except i can't change my name back for 60 days after someone hacked and changed my name -_-
it seems that facebook is getting bigger..."fat" instead of being more muscular, big but mascular.
I want to this Application previously
App is gud ,,, we knw d updates of events
Since update I can no longer play vids in facebook via the Facebook app ... Vids works fine in browser or YouTube .. they used to work ... What's gone wrong
Makin mantab...

Sticking in accessing
Does anyone else have a problem with it just closing out on its own?
We it's where we can get a better understanding of what's going on and really have a say so that's why I asked you about what's on your mind and I think that we have a pretty good hot topics
Nothing special after update.
Samsung Galaxy S3
Superppp app
Very sloppy thew galaxy :-(
Nice!
Network should be faster
On you FB!!!
Updated, and then very few pictures, and absolutely no videos would load. Uninstalled/reinstalled, and now I can't log in. Login screen loads (very slowly) all the way, then goes back to log on.
Dont like thr fact that I cant get personal conversations cause they separated messenger!!! If i download its gonna take more space!
The friend request won't disappear even after i've seen it. Fix this! It's irritating.
What happened to paste in status updates?

The current update makes the app freezing my phone. Quad-core CPU and 2Gb of memory all dedicated to a useless bug. I was sure my phone got broken until I managed to restart and kill Facebook. Delete, Google for apk 17.0.0.23.35 and install it manually, it works good
it's take lot of time to start the fb. pls fix this problem. otherwise it's awesome app but i am giving only 3stars. after this problem will solve than i will give 5 stars
Good

Its just that, you need to wait just to play the video.
This app is really nice I liked it
Good app
Still freezes up and choppy. I'm not seeing any improvements even with the updates.
Cannot enjoy app because it constantly has some type of failure or not responding message. Its aggravating since it is used to contact people I care about. Please fix problems...

The app is trippin! I like how you can share things on friends walls now, but you still can't see birthday notifications. At least not like useing the web browser. Please fix that. I haven't wished anyone a happy birthday in a long time!
Dear I cant Chang group privacy an older version plz solve this issue
Its good but it is lot of time to upload a picture almost take 5hrs to complete it
My updated Facebook is still forced close. It doesn't work well on android 2.3.7.
Very informative, a necessity .
This app sucks, it doesnt bother me before but i cant take it anymore. I cant access my account. It always says "setting up facebook...." then it just closes. i uninstalled and installed it several times but its still the same. Right now im using browser more frequently. hope you fix this.
Keeps on updating, takes up a lot of memory but still it's the same  keeps on crashing.
Facebook
It very good apps ^_^
Why ruin a perfectly good app and remove messaging? Should call it Facebook 8- like windows no one wants it.
Half baked!! Always crashes!
Facebook works rather decently on my phone. However, it's way too large of an app. Please downsize
Wow
Worst
How i report someone using fake account using my name my picture my adress and everything he know about me i want to report  fake account that someone using my biodata plz fb contact with me how i contact on facebook customer care plz facebook customer servious. Contact with me i have so much problem
Like me Or add je
you guys made a separated app just for chat. why? why make us run 2 different processes if you1guys could just make it easier and keep it all inside one app? you guys can be sure that nobody is happy about it.
Pugss .. comments don't appear .. force close ... i press like it does noy be occure at all Finally you are a group of failures not more :(
Update again what for no improvement

Have fun
Hi,after the recent update, i couldn't log in to my Facebook account. TQ
Is orrible, keeps crashing, it downloads very slow, :( give the old facebook back
Crashes & consistently says error loading feed since updated. Facebook this is the ONLY way I have to stay in contact with my family,  kids & grandkids! !! Why is this such a problem recently?  I had great trust in the ability to use Facebook to communicate with family. 5 grown kids 10 grandkids all across the country. Very disappointed. And another thing, all the random adds are such a nuisance.  I believe you've just gotten so big that you've lost your values.
Friend
Give us the option of full screen when scrolling in Landscape mode and WITHOUT the HUGE selection bar showing all the time please? Full screen as in FULL SCREEN please.
Wont let me upload a video  I checked all my phone settings Facebook settings and it's still not uploading my videos
I think 4 time i download this app...but always lose..fix pls..ty
slow to open. crashes constantly. not worth the effort to open.

Great way to find old friends and to start new friends
All Things Working Best
Thank you Facebook for this wonderful app

Thu 2nd Oct ... Again, STILL NO MOST RECENT OPTION FOR MAIN NEWS FEED.                   After all the complaints of not having the Most Recent option in the main news feed, they removed it from there altogether ... nobody gives a crap about Top Stories
I love it
This is a nice app.
Harisgee
The best
Thank you
Every time you hit the refresh button, its given you news updates from 2 or 3 days previous and its starting to get annoying.  Ive uninstall and reinstall and the problem is still there.
Won't load "previous comments" in any thread.
ILik this
Can't read any links
VERY Good
This facebook mobile is nice to be use.
Best Friends
Excellent
please fix the app!!!!
Can't copy paste statuses , Please fix it
Not really a fan of Facebook messenger and making it compulsory for texting gets very annoying. Please fix.
Do not force me to do anything! Especially not an installation of a stupid app called facebook messenger! I want my messages to be available in my facebook app! I'm deleting facebook app because there is no use for it since I can't access my messages
Keeps crashing since update.
Y can I not download this app? I had it before my fone updated then wen I looked everything was there except Facebook!!! It's saying incompatible error?
Covers the essentials of Facebooking. Works fast on HTC One (m8).
EXCELLENT
Duniya Budurwar wawa
Needs improvement for phone with low technical specs and be more power efficient\battery friendly
Nice awasome
Same here! My news feed is all whacked!  Got some post from sunday or Monday showing up and its Thursday already. Please fix! And put back the messenger on the Facebook app! News feed still out of wack now the app force closes!
I love it
Full services.
Messages should appear in this app or atleast be able to view them
Good !
Seriously. Everything that is done to "improve" the interface just makes it so much worse. There is too much going on, and, more importantly, too much that WE JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT! You're just bogging down your app with garbage, and taking away options instead of adding them isn't winning you points with anyone.
Exquisite
Good
very bad
F
Gud Sirf aapke liye! Rse par. di
when i updated the latest version, i cant use it it keeps on crashing all over again. I tried to uninstall and install it again. Nothing happened. Still not responding. Please fix this app asap. Thanks!
It is good
When ever i try play video which is uploaded in FB, it automatically logs out. Reported the issue 3 times but their is no resolution give. I still face same problem
So I recently downloaded the fb app on my phone to keep in touch with family but every time I get on fb it crashes within 5 seconds. If I try to look at a picture it crashes. If I try to scroll down my news feed it crashes. So i uninstall the app thinking that it would make a difference but it didn't. Now the fb app won't even download... Ugh this app is soo frustrating. Fix asap!!!!
It keeps showing "Setting Up Facebook" And "Just A Moment"
Great
Can't see notifications when viewing most recent now have to keep pressing back!!!
this app it chating app and did not should play the video and old app ok but he was internet first app for chating and was very important app
Latest update screwed it up on my S4, keeps running in the background and drains my battery. Battery went from 90% - 66% only after commuting for 30 mins without even touching my phone. Battery manager shows Facebook was running the background.
So good
Nice
Fails to provide the replica of Facebook website in terms of functionality. E.g. can not change cover picture of group. No search option for group. Can't create a doc or upload file. Creating album or uploading a picture is pain if it's not my recent picture. It takes lot of time to load. Instead I'll prefer to open a gallery like other apps. Few more small bugs which are really annoying.
Keeps crashing on my galaxy tab 3. Fix it please! Its so frustrating.
Nice
Like new version
Can we get a ligher version that doesnt eat too much ram?
Terima Kasih  Hmm
Speedy fast
Is the best I can talk to my frinds avryday with out my phone slowing down
Nice but if you could improve the way to upload photos, profile and cover. When uploading i end up with all my picture... instead they can classify in folders
Good
It will not even open since the last update. Really at the end of my rope with Facebook. First the message thing now this. Worthless app to me.
But too.large...
speakless
Its getting stuck for my samsung galaxy s
Shum seksi te kja
SUPER SLOW HOW CAN I UNINSTALL THIS UPDATE  IT WORKED FINE BEFORE. ????? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE AT FACEBOOK? WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO KEEP MESSING WITH THE APP. ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL LIKE INSTALLING BACK DOORS TO THE UPDATES???
Very nice app
Fair
Yupii amazing app ... Just simply loved it
Hi

Niyaj mohd.
Great tool to stay in touch with family and friends all across the world.
Facebook
I don't like this app. It consume too much ram and battery.
Facebook why do you have to try to dictate in what order I read my news feed, you don't know me or who/what I like so stop. Give the people back the freedom of choice.
Hmph.. Still recent updates.. Doesn't.. Show
Awsomee
Deleting the 120+MB app, I will use in browser facebook...
Relatelng to world smoothly
Forcing you to download the stupid messenger dont even give you a chance to choose either you want to download it or not at all!
D,ter
Disgusting app.. Consumin memory in my phone and crashin all the time.. Refusin to open.. I was better off wit the old version..
Please don't installed this app
It is consuming a lot of RAM. Pl try to control the usage of ram... It is  taking more than 40mb
It is an excellient app to user to us their fb
The app keeps freezing on my Nexus 4 and I have to exit and go back in and it restarts. It will send me the little message about Facebook is not responding and I can wait or close it. Its getting annoying. Thinking about uninstalling and just do Facebook on my browser.
Its troble to download
Good

After the last update, pictures went from clear and viewable to fuzzy and unreadable. I only use Facebook to connect with family members, which includes sharing family photos and viewing those of others. Bad quality photos are completely diminishing my experience. Want to speed up your app? Get rid of stupid video autoplay and ads. I want to see and read photos the way they were meant to be! 135 MB of internal storage used and I get crappy photo quality and useless video autoplay!
I Like it Very Much
I love it
I like the gui on which this app is made. Amazing easy access to various things on facebook
Very excellent!
The new update is too slow.
Its really gud
Its qaulity
Tumbsup

Seriously, drop the ads Facebook, you're reaching breaking point, it's high time for a new social app that's a little more considerate.
ano ba ito kanina pa ako nag dadownload hangga ngayon hindi ko sya ma download ! anong gagawin nyan ! panu ang gagawin ayaw ma download ?
What the F'ck always crashing when.fix it!!
Facebook is life.
Please unify the messenger and the main app. It's just clutter and eats up extra ram and battery

Videos take forever to play (may be limited connection) and news feed also takes forever to update... Yeah, I don't care what my friends posted 3 hours ago. Lemme see what's up NOW ... Also... Change your permissions... I don't need to have you checking out my contacts and camera without MY permission.

Its force closing every 5 min, it doesnt give notifications, it doesnt sign me off from the chat I cant tag friends, I cant delete posts I hate it
Use friendcaster instead of Facebook.

With this latest update EVERYTHING has been messed up. It's a poor update and 2 stars remain until it becomes fluent/user friendly. Since 19/9/14 I've had 3 updates..... Your platform is still a little unstable however your back up to 4 stars......
Cool
Awsm app
Keeps crashing. Got the new update and it crashed about 20 times in one hour. Thought updates were supposed to make it better not worse? How many times am I going to have to report this before you fix it? Reported about 10 times already
bad

Each time i go into the app it gets quiting
Best app
Good to connect all long distance frnd
Kept crashing and not upload new feeds
Eats up a lot of space except that, it's smooth and easy.

Does what it's supposed to, just annoying
Fast
I see messages are still here. I'll use the app until you remove it, then I'll uninstall and change rating back to 1.

Kind of disappointed how much Facebook has gone downhill
Updates have required unnecessary permissions, news feed timeline is crap and jumps around half way through reading them and now links open in its own browser window! What's the opposite of improving? That's what has happened with the app.
Enable messaging option back on this Facebook app. 5 star if Facebook app be a standalone app again
I like this app so much...but the problem is I dont want to download fb messenger but it looks like they are forcing us...
So so
Fun
I love it
After updating it will be very slow and hanging
Poor
Good app and easy to use
Cool
My facebook
this aap is very intresting aap really nice....
Nice app
Without msg app I can't send msgs..? Why the f...?
Just like so many other users, I use an older version & Facebook on my mobile browser. This app has to many is for me to install only to not getting used taking up valuable data space

When it's go ahead from the Sentece of Wait A Just Moment bad update.

This app is of no use when you are not able to update your status. . Improve this and will give full five stars
Awesome
Good to good
Its like mirror
I don't know why but it doesn't open... :s
Takes up too much memory card and device space
It is a fairly satisfying app.

Absolutely terrible keeps on crashing every 30 seconds every time i click on anything crashes cant do anything worst update ever also i thought updates were meant to fix issues the latest update has done nothing to fix any issues
.. I in all honesty.. Hate the conditions for having to use a seperate messenger app.. and the fact that that app has ridiculous terms to accept.. that clearly violate our privacy..
What the hell is happening to facebook, it keeps on crashing and too slow to open the app.
Facebook used to be a good way to keep in contact with friends near and far... but not anymore with how BS the service is, lack of privacy, and with sooo many permissions. Is this where you guys flop like Myspace did? Uninstall-1 star. Pathetic.
This app is shit and uses up way too many mb's. I mean seriously Twitter uses under 50mb's but you guys use more than 100. News feed gas gone to shit as it doesn't show the newest post but instead ones from last week. Get your shit together and make a good app for fucks sake. There was no fucking reason to remove messenger from the main app you useless fucktards

This new update is really cool. Using complete real estate. Just love it.
Do you really wanna advice for this apps to work flawless in your device ? Go to settings : uninstall - clear data & then try to installed again with helping from your own Mobile/Modem WIFI, that works for me !!!
I like it.

Buggy App :(
Well since I havent used this phone I cant access my account and u wont contact me? Awesome. I forsee this getting closer to its demise like myspace.
I only keep it to keep up with long distance friends and relatives. It keeps crashing after update. Been sayin that since the app was first started!! Facebook needs to hire people who actually know what they are doing!!
Make to fast.
It's ok
Facebook going in the wrong direction.
It so cool
Wow! Faster than F1 cars
Awesome
Tari
In it all
Very amazing
You dont allow me to open Facebook messages without messanger..
Its waste app as it's taking much time to start
nocarga las notificaciones y tengo que desactivarla y volver a activar mi cuenta.....muy muy mala.
Very poor app
They need to quit updating it. It's taking up way too much room on my phone. I don't have that many apps but this one takes 150 megabytes out of my phone memory really??(Update) Honestly ya'll need to quit updating facebook!! Just keep it simple quit trying to be myspace! And yes I said MYSPACE!
Good

Shii
The app would be perfect if I could nice it to my SD card
Limited usage...far too bad comparing to the web version
Love you Ana
It's Ok..sometimes diffcult to navigate.
This app works just fine and i honestly don't like my phone. I would do some looking into phone settings and like the last person said stop some unnecessary apps. Its not slow and Im quite happy w it working efficiently and so user friendly.
I've been off for about 3 or 4 months but now won't let me load. POS
You can't choose to have your News Feed be set at Most Recent at all. You can't download any videos at all. The task bar where you can normally choose to Update your status or upload a picture is on the bottom. The viewing screen where you can see what people post and scroll is smaller.  Go suck a homeless man's dick Facebook.
Very annoying
Very good
It takes more then 100mb space for this =(
Its fantastic app and a helpful app Ever seen I love it .........
Gees, I could go to the shops and back while It's still loading......

The latest update on my Samsung Tab 3 does not work worth a crap! I cannot share anything or even view the app without it shutting down. To say this is glitchy or unreliable is a gross understatement.  To be fair I am not sure if the problem is in the app itself or within the latest android or samsung update but the end result is the facebook app it worthless!!
Fb app plus the messenger! how about low specs devices which only 5xxmb of RAM??
It's awesome
This app is actually pretty awesome!  ;)
Bhalo
Why all this useless updates all the time using precious memory? Why not put back news feed to most recent? Like it used to be! Why not listen to customers? Since last update FB keeps shutting down and now you want us to update again? Why ruin something that was working just fine before these silly updates? And much more annoying things to say but take won't waste my time! YOU WON'T LISTEN ANYWAY!
Crashes CONSTANTLY!  Getting really frustrating.
Don update to new release update, totally cannot open tge apps, please revent it.
I m njoying this software..
No privacy! !
I think it fulfill my needs
Should not disable the messenger in the Facebook app. That's the better and faster way to connect with ppl.
Thise is app is very nise
Apa khabar
But the think is, its work to slow, and having so much time to load page.. even my phone when have 200kb net speed this app is run slow. so i request that to you please fix this app..
Nice
Gets stuck sometimes.. But other than that, it's an amazing app!
Hmm
For me now, just the best news streaming app. Best of all, I choose my news sources. Anything else is just bonus material.  However, would love to know how the "new" friends suggestions are "precipitated"! One annoying thing though,  is the "switching" to latest news whilst I'm trying to catch up with older streams. Can this be a voluntary action pliz!! At least I can be taken to "the top" only once when I open the app.
This is good
Very good aps.
So slow...

Why is the about you gone? I need to fix some profile info on mobile and cant.

The one thing I've always disliked about Facebook is that the menus don't make any sense. I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for.
Amazing App

Takes a long time updating it
Nice media
Nice app but plzzz make some shortcuts like blocking facility on one click
Co mwaaah app ever...
Well
Facebook developers must not read these reviews. If they did, then i would feel its safe to assume that they'd have fixed the constant crashing. Im uninstalling until this is fixed. Maybe if we all did, they'd get it worked out.
Awsome...
After completion of download saying that error could not be downloaded
After installing this app on my galaxy s3 mini phone memory slows down fix this and I will pay u a 3 million dollar cash and a 5 star
Worst app on my phone.
Why they still keep asking to download the fb messenger.. I don't want to download it. Just want to use the fb app..
After I updated cannot open
Osm
Love it
The quality of Facebook has decreased day by day. The major companies that are in its competition are doing way better. Even after acquiring WhatsApp, there was no major effect. Its about time that they make some serious updates if at all they wish to survive the market.
very nice
There are a lot of improvements in the app. And it keeps getting better.
SUPPER ALL THE WAY
Get some work here....
Stop! Having stupid messanger as a requirment messanger is the dumbest thing ever!
Problen login. When u going through your news feed it automatically takes u up to the start.

Keeps crashing off Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy 3). I see I'm not the only one having this problem. Have uninstalled and then reinstalled but it's still happening.
Great!
A bad update  D previous 1 was much better....
Very good app
Its for older version
Ok
Reinstalled the app on phone, thinking might run leaner without the messenger, but it's worse than ever. Crashes to launcher screen EVERY SINGLE TIME! figure it out, with mobile, leaner is better, not this bloated piece of junkware.
Veri interested
Only to talk to friends and family
Freeze and crashes, HTC one m7
I have tried force closing it, uninstalling it, and it still freezes until I restart my phone. It happens multiple times a day.

U guys need to work really hard on it.Its annoying...time consuming...irritating. keeps crashing every now n then. Doesn't even meet expectations ! Its been so many days that you r reading negative feedback about this .....Big let down
Great app but still sad that they removed sms from messenger
Nice
it's slow and cant copy anything in news feed plz update this :-\
This app is ridiculous. Even though I say I want "Most Recent" post the things that are showing are 8+ hours ago. WTH fix this!

Must
It easy to make :*
Love it
Lovely app
Takes to much storage whyyyyyy????????
What the hell is going on ? Always crash after update the latest version ! Please fix it !!!
Icannot see all my msgz
First of all, for those complaining about the complainers of this app: Go away. (I want to say something else, but they may censor it.) Using the excuse of, "you could just use the website in your browser" is THE dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Secondly, this app wastes more time than before. You can't easily edit your comments on other posts, and you can't default it to show your feed by the most current. There is twice as much advertising, too, which doesn't help data usage on data-limited connections.
Desmond
Thanks for fixing location issues.
Bueno
Continuacion
nice
Great
Was great but sucks now
Good app bt a little heavy.....bt worth it
After the update, the app won't open. I need to uninstall and install it again. It's getting worst.
Now there's only the possibility to share through post on friend's or own timeline. Please enable sharing posts through messages. Thanks.
The update says - Improvements for reliability and SPEED. seriously? Where the hell is the improvement there? It always sayd setting up facebook, plus, its SLOWER then before!! R u guys thinking backwards now? YOUR UPDATES ARE USELESS AND STUPID!!!

I m update Facebook 4 days ago now it is come update
Not able to select text from status n not able to share pics in comment bo
Very excellent apps
Greatest chatter

Lost its fizz a long time ago, messaenger does not respect privacy.
Laggy overall. Freezes every Time I go to search for someone and crashes when I try to search a friend's friend list. Please fix.  Oh and bring back messaging I'm sick of using messenger!
Its great ! I have no problems with it on my note 3 :)

Keka bai
Great place to meet fate .. DoG  ..  To My Friends ..
I dont get notifications from people posting on my wall but from people commenting on posts that I've commented on. All my settings are set to give notifications of everything... All this worked until the new update. *edited update* my app is now not allowing my contacts to sync with existing contacts on my phone... What's up with this update?!
I find the app works well, easy to use.
Slow.. Loadin tym for new feeds takes long...
The apps said, i need to uninstall it and redownload.. after i did it, during installing, it always crashing down
Always facebook setting blah blah!
My facebook updated and now there is no icon on my screen for it, just the name facebook is present
GREAT
I didnt expect disss.... Its slow and not so responsive.
My only issue is, sometimes when opening a link to a website from within the app.. Chrome will crash.
Facebook used to be so much better.  I dont know what happened, but have issues with fb app just shutting off whene c er it feels like it!  If it wasnt for hafing friends that i keep in touch with i would never have fb again.  Fix this app to work the way it needs to be so myself and others will enjoy it!  Thank you
i dont mind much even though the app is buggy as hell but after the latest update the app is always stucked at the "setting up for facebook" page and i cant even login to the app for christ sake! just uninstalled rubbish app since it does nt work anymore
I love it
Please dont update.better use facebook in your browser.

One shouldnt require two apps to do what one could with one. I'm using the browser from now on.
New update causes app to not even open!!! Screen goes black and back to my home screen when I try to launch it!!!
Latest update doesn't load my news feed anymore
Nice

Thanks for my life
Why do I want to see posts from days ago that I've already seen! Please fix to show most recent posts first!
I still see stutters here and there but it has got a lot better.  5 stars if it is completely smooth
I have used this app for last 4-5 years and i am happy to being this app but this updated version is very irritating for me when i trying to log out this it's seem to crashed and blank screen appear and i also don't want to log in fix this bug i am so depressed.

Slowly getting worse and worse
It makes me lose my spot on the news feed while I'm scrolling. It refreshes by itself. It crashes often. It works better through the internet explorer. I think its slowing my phone down as well. Going to uninstall soon if problems are corrected.
Best social media
when I download the photo it keeps on error
2 apps for full functionality?  Wtf. I think its time I switched to g+.
This updated version is very good . User interface is awesom.
Unlike other users I don't face any problem. Facebook app runs perfectly. I think some people don't know how to use their phone. It's a nice app & well maintained by Facebook staff, thank you.
Is expected
Only App Available
Give some  updates and   More improvement needed
best way to contact friends family and other stuff
Can't make events on group pages, pics load intermittently, uploading comments to pics is a crap shoot as the caption text may or may not stick the first time you enter it.
Ever since the update I cannot open  a link that has been posted by another person. Fix this
Not bad! but sometimes it gets stopped and hangs mobile
Aaesome...
Always crashing and lagging.
why the option of copying letter is not present like browser?major fault of facebook apps
great
Working
Stop the freakin refreshing
Not bad... could be better.
Its getting better
Everytime I open facebook and try to view a photo or comment it crashes and sends me back to the sign on page. Help!
May take additional care for hanging of app in next update :-)

Most link on post cannot be opened on browser like chrome on lg optimus g kitkat.
not upto mark :/
Hope more improments and bug fixs.
Gud mssnger
Good
Fix the glitches since the last update!
The app is good.....but crashes need to be fixed
Coool
No comments 5 star to this app
Fb

Love it.
My family
Good
1st one was fine had no problems but evry time u make a new and inporved verstion it gets worse wanting more memoery. I cant barely log on with out it freaseing my phone and crashing ! Think i get pics and leave fb if i could get 0*s the i would. Twitter anyone ?
App freezes and shuts down when clicking on ANY link in my feed. My newsfeed is also now cluttered with posts that are several days old and there is no way to sort or view 'most recent' posts like you could before. Sorry but I want to know what's going on NOW--not what happened 3 days ago. What's the point of this?!?? Had this update for 3 days now and guess what? I'm not using Facebook as much! I'm really tempted to delete this huge space hogging app off my phone for good since it doesn't work...
Facebook App Will Not Let Me On Setting Up Facebook Appears. Please Fix it.
Wnt download
Won't even go into facebook; keeps saying "just a moment". I left it on that screen for over an hour and nothing happened.
Good
I really like this app
Lookin up past life
Great communication application.....
The best thing about this app for android is it is getting improved with each update
Old version is much better.. when i updated it i can no longer connect instantly if there's no wifi unlike the old one. So bad.. :'(
FAB
This needs to be fixed asap! I can't post statuses or anything. What is the point of Facebook if I can't post anything???
Any time says updated again
Akshaybijali1234671
Can't open app anymore since update. I have even tried rebooting phone. ATRIX
Good
Please fix asap
Super like
After a few month, this app still sucks.
I like it
Very good
Good
facebook  is nice app
good
Super
Resuming the app after a while from the background after doing some multi tasking with other apps, the app is taking me back to the start of the news feed's  recent post instead to my old viewing news, this sucks I need to go back to my old news, it sucks my time and irritating
Without chat messages this is shit
Can't even install on my phone after update. It SUCKS EVERY BIT OF MEMORY OUT OF MY PHONE. I even uninstalled the other apps I use & it still won't go so I Put my other apps back on. Now I will do without FB on my phone. Unless they come up with a way to reduce the amount of space they take up. Shame on Facebook !
Fastesp app
Takes time to download this app
Y do you need so much from my phone for messages looks like i wont be messaging
Ok
After install is become a huge size.
I can't play videos for some reason! It's a bug! Please fix it! Htc one m8
Horrible
bagina
Ikaw na
so slow ..
hate that it wants you to use messenger liked the old school messages through face book that's why got rid of messenger by fore this update guess I'll see if here's any apps out there similar to the old facebook
Two thumbs up!
It's the slowest app on my phone. Hope it gets better with android L

Awesome app
Since splitting messenger into its own contact slurping app, there's little reason to put up with the additional bloat over just having a browser shortcut to the Facebook website.

Very good app
all cool, but add the option to make our previous profile picture again..
Uses too many resources. Please give the option to choose it or not. It forced me to DL it again. I WILL NOT DL MESSENGER. either make it an option or I'm going to twitter and never coming back. I love how the developers Dont listen to the people. Is it THAT hard to offer a choice?
Broken
Ever since the last update nothing loads on my feed..pictures..statuses..comments ect!! I have to do little tricks every time to get things to load and even then it only works for a min or 2. Rebooting my phone doesnt help it either. I usually turn off my wifi and turn it back on and get back in FB app and then a few pictures will load but only a few! I have to keep turning my wifi off and on every min or 2 just to get things to load..annoying!!!!!!
Lovely app
This new update totally sucks! nobody wants news feeds from 13 hours ago. We just want the most recent. Why do ya'll keep doing this? Now you can't even choose which you want?! A bit ridiculous. I sure hope ya'll get this crap fixed. I'm not very happy!!
I remember when this first came out for Android. It was crap, the the next couple updates made it even worse. Now, is actually usable. They listened to the users kinda.
Shoaibmians@yahoo. Com i like it
Y so much updates??????????
Facebook
Nice place to be friend
Awesome
Good
Really wish I could actually see most recent posts and not just a bunch of random ones even though most recent is on!
Since the update crashes all the time.. sucks
Good
Loved it
Why can't I update the fb on my phone?
It consumes lot of ram
Can't download please solve the problem
Great
terbaik
K....
Thanks .
good app
Loved it
Instead of hiding the "Most recent" view, add a setting option to give the users freedom of choice.
Love it!!!!!!!!!!!! #AWESOME
Cool
App is good overall.
This version is also good but earlier versions were better
Nice
This is best way i communicate with the ones i love and miss so much
Nice
Interesting
This app was once a good app but now I can't even enter my password. Try and fix it I use this app everyday! And, now I have to use my browser which I really dislike.
Always shuts down now when clicking on a link.
Not very intuitive, works okay to spot-check & comment, but I find myself frustrated or saying "Why can't I..." everytime I use it. Posting to managed pages impossible at times and difficult to view pages I manage. WEAK!
Good
Because I have to delet all my thing on my phone
Ok la
This app is very heavy and very slow to use. It must be little lighter.
Good ..
Never lose touch
kv
Totally unusable now on my Nexus 7 (2013). Setting up... Then it eventually works or just crashes.
Love this app!!
Great!

Facebook is like love to me
Why do we need to install another app to see our messages? It seemed like it worked fine before. Dumbest update ever! Also I will not install the messenger app. I have text messaging for that...
Updates still haven't fixed the app closing after clicking share for Android on Galaxy Tab 3
Fack book apps iam download frst 200mb free ram but fb app dwnld after 25mb free ram its waste of ur data balance and ur ram
Fb will know everything about you :)
Chat is  not opening  on facebook application
U penis
IT SUCKS. All Bitches with attitudes.
I love it
thanks for being with me for ten or maybe more...
The app keeps freezing while scrolling or when pulling up comments.
I had the app and then i read the conditions. Why should facebook be allowed to read sms messages and record voices. Really stupid.
To mini errors
Its cooooool lol.                  FU Jeremy
This app,is better than,getting,head while smoking a blunt
I hate your browser, take this sh*t back
This app has turned into garbage. Always kick me off and rebutting.  Freezes all the time. Starting to drive me nutts!! In the middle of a post or comment and...... rebut!! Grrrr!!
Crashhhh
Either keeps crashing, or close on you unexpectedly can't post anything here read anything can go to my own Facebook page without it crashing constantly this is ridiculous worst app ever.
hlo facebook ta hun varri varri update  e turi aundi main kal rat update keete c  parhun pher update main taitain delete e kardeene abas...vaddu a ata netpack...gandi fb
Thanks
Cool
Update
Fab app. ........really love it
Best... Best......
There any many error in Facebook for Android  Before i had an iphone and there the facebook app is a lot better in my opinion!  How can i delete my aktive chats for example?
I use Facebook to keep up with family and friends from all around the world.  For some odd reason it wouldn't open.  I had it uninstalled.  I tried it again and now I just says its taking a moment and continues to crash.  That's really my only issue.  Please can you fix the app.  Very concerned customer.
It's good
Love it but too much space and its kinda stupid that we need 2 apps just to have facebook and them our messages! Anyways good good though!
Anytime you go to view a linked YouTube video on Facebook it automatically links you to the mobile browser site instead of the YouTube app. I have tried everything to reset the defaults in chrome, my stock browser, and the YouTube app to no avail. I believe this is an update Facebook made so it can open videos in the browser by default and now I can't change it. Annoying.
I like it, I just wish you could get photo effects when you upload a picture to facebook like the IPhone does, I clearly have an android .
Awesome
Aji
U suckkkk...y did u have to make it mandatory for us to use facebook messenger??? Simply bullshit...pls fb admin keep thngs simple for us...many ppl i knw have deleted fb app frm their phs bcos of this...ull lose more n more if u keep up your bs...i giv u one star bcos i cnt giv ZERO!!
I cant get the app its no fair....
Lot of unwanted updates.daily updates
Good app great speed
Big improvement in new update
Micuuuuuuuuu
Too many wake locks and is a battery drainer.
Not response & always updated didn't fix a thing, pls fix it...
Won't open links in Chrome. Keeps crashing. Galaxy S5
Pls put back the custom setting for posting status
Always updating and no bugs. Thanks!
FIX CRASHING. STab3.
Again a new update? This tym it will crash more? Seriously u need to  improve till then iam disabling facebook app.. And yes "WE DO NOT WANT MESSENGER"
I will not be forced to.download an.app just to see my messages!  Stupid.
Just like on the website, every 'upgrade' makes it suck more and more. There's a reason people spend less time on it these days... I have better things to do. Put the messenger functionality back and then we'll talk.
Facebook's new feature of opening links in the app itself is very great like that of iOS ..Was waiting for this..do keep this feature implement in the future !!! Thanks
About facebook
After update, application will close immediately after show my time line.
Dear Facebook, let me use Facebook the way I want to. I do not like TOP STORIES, I prefer MOST RECENT. But you all have made it inconvenient to get most recent news feed.
Update Rocks!!
The news stream is pretty much worthless now. I don't want to search for most recent news. Top news is great but recent is best. I barely use Facebook because of the changes. I would delete this off my phone if I could. Garbage app. Need to work on Google wear compatibility.
Its really good
I like it
I hate this app because many times i tried to sign but doesnt workingg
I would give it 5 stars but now it sucks cuz i have to have the facebook messanger and i dont like the app for messanger cuz i cant sign out of it
I like it
Just the best Social Networking experience!
Facebook app consume so much space in my tablet, can u make it a little low on storage space?
If there n0 star to give a comment. I will not gave even 1
Wow
Why does it always crush and lags? it also eats too much IM space on my phone and doesn't have the option to be moved in the SD card.. i put up with you guys forcing me to DL the messenger app so i can still recieve and send messages but this is too much..

Ive downloaded this app 3 times and it keeps booting me out of the app. Something needs to be done. I have a galaxy tab 3 the update does not work.
Awesome
You keep changing the face on my phone!!! I HATE IT! DON'T FIX IF IT'S NOT BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this app/website is bs. forcing its users to install an unwanted messenger app if we want to message people. n the app permissions are so bs and not necessary at all. Facebook as no need to be inside my phone call areas. messages or anything. just sit there n act pretty. and it needs to stop changing my settings. I dont want facebook to auto update I press to take it off n facebook changes the settings back to auto update. its bs! I hate this app in all ways.
112233nh
Hatee itttt!!!!!!! rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I like because i came chat my family in other states
I went from 5 stars to 3 stars due to the new instant messenger app I do not agree with them having full network access especially to my camera and my recording device.
GETTING WORSE!
I very like it
I don't like the fact you have yo download another app to see your message.
Great app. Everybody business is on here
We have still do I need to go to the Internet to reply to a notification comment.
Loved it
Very glitchy, everytime i atempt to open a video or a photo or even open notifications it will crash and i have to reload it. Disappointing.

Still needs to be able to reply to a notification without going to internet...and get pokes
Nice..
I lik this
Like it
Works perfect after update
Spyware collecting private data forcefully.
Awesome!!!
Why do we have to have stupid messenger to read our messages from people on facebook? That is so stupid. I think facebook should allow us to see our facebook messages on facebook not a stupid extra app. The point of facebook was to communicate with friends but now you cant get the messages from your friends unless you download a whole new app. Its stupid.
As I'm going through news feed or seeing a video or reading a persons comments it closes on me and or stops working this is getting to frustrating to even go on Facebook anymore it also goes right back to the beginning without cause or action for example if I'm reading a post all of a sudden it will go to the beginning of news feed without prompt and its annoying please fix this
Ok
Why you did not make camera roll into folder, that more easy to find pic than camera roll at the present..
Love finding old friends   and new ones.
It crashes every few clicks.  It is great for scrolling down your news feed,  but try to click on anything and there is a 50% chance the house of cards will come crashing down.  You have to open the app back up and try again.
Crash crash crash crash crash crash crash crash crash crash
DISGRACEFUL! !!  WHEN I CLICK on notification menu the POKE from others is Never There. ....PL FIX. ..
Good
Need to make most recent news the real news

Facebook is the best.
plsss.....
improve this.....
For friend make
Easy to use
Awesome
Raj
You need to fix all the problems....
Nice search engine.
I can't post videos tf  is going on
I think it gets worse everyday.  Please fix this very soon.
Super interesting everybody should have it in their cellphones right?
*sigh* too many bugs.
Cool
Aftrr the update last night, now sign in failed !!! Grrrr need to try again and again ..hello, no good...
When I'm browsing my news feed the app decides to force close on it's own. It happens at random times throughout the day and multiple times at that.
Useless one
It's completed and utter Bullshit how I have to keep deleting Facebook Just so I can download another app because Facebook is 130 some mb, it's ridiculous. That's way to much space, and messenger doesn't help either because of every thing it can do.
The Best
I dont know why its all slow and doesn't work and i need to exit out of the app and re open it please fix this Google thanks

Should go with most recent by default.
Still needs to made to where it can be moved to SD storage
It's some what good
not able to play videos... app crashes.....
Social media
I love it.
I love this app. It helps me talk to my friends and see pictures of them that I can save! I don't see anything wrong with it
Tannu
Excilent
Nice
This update sucks news feeds are all out of order navigation  on the site sucks so put it back like it was this is the worst update ever. Still sucks  forced to download messenger just to chat to FB friends.
This app is awesome It just needs to reduce the app storage space
Keeps crashing now, and I have to get messenger to see private messages. I think I will continue to log on through my phone browser as that is better.
Awesome.... 
I  did my password it did go to shoron mcfarlane
Wow wow wow
Myopinion
Shocking app. Constantly freezing
To maol updates i dont care for the
To slow and always not responding. Take many ram. Crash suddenly. Fix it.
Looks through all your sms messages, call logs and other personal data. Stay away from this. Unplug from this company that is stealing your identity.
Will not open since last update
Facebook app keeps freezing, crashing or dumping me out of the app.  Please fix
Stinks that u don't have option and you have to use that carp messenger! !!
Updated and is so slow. Frustrating that if I follow a link and then go back to Facebook, it takes me to the top of news feed again.
Grand maratha *****
All of these constant updates creates havoc on my phone. I know it may come as a surprise, but I have more than just Facebook on my phone, then I HAVE to have messenger downloaded to be able to IM my friends and family...it's completely ridiculous! I expect more out of such a highly used and profitable business.
slow to open on my android devices
Why did they change the way web links open through the app!? It keeps crashing when I try to follow a link to read an article or watch a video my friends posted!!!! Ugh! Just when you get used to the changes, they go and change it again creating a problem where there wasn't one in the first place!!!!
This is a real creative app
Your stupid update logged me out, changed my password and won't let me back in!
Its good
Every single time they update I have to change my settings. I'm about one update away from closing my account. And the in app browser is just garbage. I have a browser, I downloaded it and set it as the default for a reason.
Cool
Still foreclosing, pleqse keep updating
I Love It
Fantastic app for me..
Wow
Not working! Freezing and foreclosing. Won't open
Shame that this still has no reply to comments on pages. Very frustrating.
Facebook
Good
It's ok...not great, not bad...but ok. I like it.
Works well except it's annoying how it jumps back up to the top of your news feed every now and again!
Have a comment. But don't be rude.
Its v good apo
Since the last update I have no problem. Good improvement.
The best
The app is too big and uses too much memory.
The new update isn't letting me load any video at all on Facebook,  and it's very slow...
Facebook is my life line .
Coo
Yes it was very nice apps
... 3
My facebook notifications don't come thru my phone no more and i don't know why.
L
I luv dis app
Ahmad Tijani Abdullahi
It's great that we're FINALLY able to turn notifications on or off from the app but it doesn't work. I still get notifications after turning them off. Also, it's annoying that the app refreshes itself while I'm scrolling through my wall. I have the refresh interval set to never but yet, it still refreshes.
You will love it too
Annoyed
Debbie moss3300@
Sorry, there's really not any words known to mankind that does this app any justice. And not in a good way.
Normal
Feckin ting keeps stopping, error upon error. Not quick, not showing news feed.
Does not load
Facebook keeps freezing on my samsung s5
Suxz if u don't have one , .
Since updating it, whenever I stay on for extended lengths of time it start slowing down, freezes, the closes out. I have to deal with this multiple times within a single hour. Please fix this......
Love it
While it seems to function better than before, I don't understand why so many issues on a common phone. S4
I seems to be needed for a reason , because nobody just hates it. They give it a test before knocking it .I think it needs time..before long we'll all apreashate it.not my spelling
Thing is ridiculous, I refuse to have to download two different apps for one freaking service, whoever made that call sucks
You guys are just assholes.
Meh
We need more things
Well done
Hatttteeee iiiitttt
Still not like desktop view or even closer
Ok
Could still be better
Keeps freezing and force closing
News feed doesn't save my preference to see most recent posts.  Lots of crap on my timeline
Nice
The permissions it asks for are outrageous. There is no reason it needs access to my hardware controls or my text messages.
Please fix
App
I cant play any videos
I don't want to download your stupid messenger app. It was fine before! Stop trying to fix things that aren't broke and work on the ones that are!
It's bad update Instagram
Every update no videos. Getting pretty crappy
This app crashes more than a drunk blind person driving in reverse. Can you please stop 'improving' it please and just make it work. So unbelievably annoying and frustrating to use...
Facebook keeps growing in size and it takes up too much storage on my phone.
Helpful
You get to  talk with freiends
Keeps getting worse. Now won't even open
Nice connected anytime
Always crash -_-
My Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 keeps crashing within 30 seconds..My Samsung Galaxy S 3 phone works fine..looking at reviews I'm not the only Galaxy Tab 3 user with this issue..please fix for us..very frustrating..
It crashes ALL THE TIME. I'm always having to send crash reports. It's ridiculous. I love Facebook but this app can seriously suck a dick. Hey, maybe it works better for someone else. I don't know.... to me, it's just a waste of space.
When you click on a link it now opens a browser within the app it does not play videos and if the article is to long it crashes....
Facebook page
This is my favourite application
Beautiful application to stay connected wind frnds in hectic busy schedule..
Best ever
Not very good super slow
Kool
This is awesome :-)
Very slow
Now I hate this app because I need an extra app which takes a lot of space and a lot of RAM on my phone just to send messages, also the Messenger App drains my battery really fast! So please bring back the messaging feature to Facebook app!!
Pra quem gosta de usar o facebook essa  a melhor forma!
The fact that the gov't owns it I rarely use it.. they be spying Idk if people know it but look at the permissions this app and messenger use.. they are aloud to record video and sound whenever they want without your permission.. I don't like that at all
Always stops... should have maintain the old version than this one... :(
Is pretty good its a little slow sometimes but nice pages
den anigei tipota
Loose the new messenger!
My girl has why not me! Ha I got it? Ya my girl got it ha so do I kev the name.
Download masih tidak stabil dan juga masih stop working...
Otherwise Facebook will just die out like MySpace
Face to face encounters make your world
So great
Love the ergomomy of the app. BUT! The news feed is a steaming pile of proverbial!
Noufal.m
Keeps crashing. ......
Pocong

Restart your phone.
Works good
I like it it a  great way to connect to family and friends
I dont know what was in the last update but now i cant even get in facebook.
Can't delete comments etc. Please fix.

Love this app
Fb won't play videos on my lg nexus 5 but works on other phones, please fix.
Good
Get on
Love it or hate it its Facebook and it's here
I hate that you can't reply to people who message you from the app... You have to have messenger. I don't message people unless someone messages me so I don't want the messenger app. I uninstalled the messenger app after I saw all the unnecessary permission it's asking for. Please fix that FB.
Nice
I cant update it!
Give Facebook access to every single part of my phone? I'm not that much of an idiot.
Like it
100%
Usual
How do I get rid of it it isn't my profile on it
Still can't access my messages within the Facebook app. Put it back.
My messenger doesnt work
Ok
Face book is very poor
This app update sucks
Now u can keep in touch to ur love ones anywhere and anytime..
can't open the open the app. says it's not responding and closes please fix!
I'm getting really bored with Facebook, like co stant updates etc is just annoying and really does it even change anything? Wish other people would just start using google+ so i coyld delete this crap.
I like it, but it still crashes sometimes.
Excellent
Nice video not download
Kinda messed up but its cool I just hate when people randomly add you when u don't know them >.< geez
facebool
Video is not working properly untill I pressing volumn buttons fix it as soon as u can..
I don't want messenger

I love the facebook app
App is a good app but the most recent tab should definitely be the standard first one that appears when you open up, rather than top stories!
:)
Great app!...needs a little work though.
Facebook
Starting up is very slow
I like what one guy said. Just remove old version and start with a FRESH update!!! Why do I have 150+ MB sucked up for ONE APP?????? ALSO BATTERY DRAIN!!
Lol
After this update it won't load. It says setting up Facebook. Wtf guys?
its ok but Some time bas....just a moment
Like
This app takes too much battery.

Finally added photos to the comments. Thanks a million
stupid doesnt load and you keep updating it, why not update the app then send the update out  Rated 0 out of 5
Happy
App keeps freezing then crashing, cannot open links to Google Chrome/Internet browser, sometimes app will not load at all (just opens to white screen), phone is running slower after last update. Please fix - this has been going on for a few weeks. Samsung Galaxy Note 2
Fabulous
Best app ever
Perch due app scadenti, che si rimandano a vincenda in modo scadente, per un unico servizio scadente?
It's great that now you can check , post and do a lot of things off-line.  Good job guys!
It keeps forclosing And freezes n takes forever to load
Good
Can't even send posts as private messages anymore. The newsfeed updates randomly sending you right back to the top of it without a warning that there are new posts. Heavy on the system. Samsung Galaxy Note 3.
Awesome
Slow slow slow super slow...
Excellent
Cool
Since last update app crashes constantly
Problem got fixed where I couldn't open any videos! Sweet:)   *Another update*  Loving the new updates

They are randomly shutting down features and reinstating them, just for the sake of regular updates.
Tai
Still needs work! Hate that it forces me to download messenger! Treading the apple line!
Facebook is good to me the reason why it is good because yhu get to contact people anytime yhu want
Sick of looking at week old posts first. Bring back the Most Recent post option!
Not good
Finding lost friends and new ones
If it ain't broke...leave it alone lol
Always useful application
Its okay but it freezes on a Galaxy S1
Memory consuming..!! Reloading speed sucks...!! U cn improve it..!! But overall good
It takes too long to load it drives me crazy also says error when I have excellent internet access also grows in mb real fast it goes from like 20mb to 70mb in seconds after download
It sucks that you have to download another app just to message someone on facebook.
when i use facebook on chrome browser can reply on every comment but, i can't comment in app!
Lovely
Awesome Stuff
Clicking on links in the feed cause the app and browser to crash, think has to do with the new lm.url thing
App has been improved a lot since first! Amazing!
Since latest update it always freezes. I want the older version back.
Fabulous
The app will not stay open longer than 30 on my samsung galaxy tab 3 , its the only app that does this. It works fine on my phone but is useless on my tablet.
Kako promeniti da vidim most recent news?
Its beautiful to navigate but is really slow especially for indian 2g users . Just make the app a little more compact and a bit faster .
Without this app I couldn't talk to my girlfriend
I don't like people being able to see when the last time I got on FB
After downloading & installing the latest update, the app cant work. It tries to load & immediately closes.How long do we have to wait for a fix?
My favorite app in the world
Nathon
exlent
When you gonna add option  "dislike"
Good app
Sorry facebook community. Im not satisfied with your terms and condition . Pls remove the advert of fb messanger
Jii
This newest update seems to have broken video playback of posts in my feed on my Necus7(2013). Still can't share posts. Makes no sense to me. This is the original basic premise of fb.
Loved it
How do you spy on over a billion people at once?...Facebook...
With the intended recipient you are the best!
Still have problems with password "and login, along with friend status, other than that, lts grand!
I love the apps...
I literally have to update this once a week. It's irritating.
It is working as expected. So what else needed?
Mrs
But still needs work. Like being  able to customize who sees your posts (you can do it on the computer and web)
Messanger -_-
Mobile app keeps closing on Samsung 3 tablet
I like this page cause I have Tobe contact my friends so easy far or near in my site loved it very well.
Keeps crashing on my Samsung tab 3!!!! Fix it and I'll rate it better!!
Nice to use and very fast

Latest updates make Facebook terrible. I hate Facebook.    It stinks and does not work like they said.
All on
Love it
The old Facebook icon is starting to annoy me
After update it's not working
Tem horas que nao quer entrar :(  
mais ou menos bom.. 
Poderia ser melhor!
excellent app
Hi
Keep it as longer dont giving thanks kathy !! :-)
Would like to be able to reply to other people's comments.  Like I can on my computer version.
Hate it  this just playing  my
Wonderful
Owsam
Love it
Hm,
kum.
i dont like it at all i cant upload my photos from my gallery and i uninstalled it to reinstall but its not working
It shouldn't force you to update. I cannot open Facebook now unless i update it? Every person hates the update and has problems and you force people to install messenger??? What is this crap you got going on? Shouldn't be forced to do it.
We can see posts play games etv
I need to know how to combine 2 facebook accounts.  I can find nothing to help me.  Grrr.
Redundant.
Jst wooow
Like
:-)
HTC one M8..We all know that...what it is...
Easy to use
Why do I hav to sign in so many times
Wow looks nyc
Absolutely hate not being able to receive inbox messages like before. I will not download Messenger app. It is entirely too invasive of my privacy.
Hell with ur updates..!!!
Love
Www. Sex. Com
Always slowing Facebook
Can't make copy for the texts
Fast. Simple. Reliable. Smooth and just love the app. Great work zuckerberg!
It keeps interrupting my games by freezing.

Nothing new
F*ck you! I have to post something and it's not working! News feed is not even loading!
Thanks
Getting better
Good
Hmmm
You need to make other message folders accessable from the app.
My account has been updating/ down for maintenance for 24 hours ( when it says I will be able to log back in a few minutes )  and the let us know section requests to submit a report. However I can't log in, there for I can't submit a report.
Good
Getting better
This app is horrible. I deactivated my account because I was so fed up with it
Is great
Gg
Messenger is evil.
Why did you remove messaging from within the mai app! I do not want to install another memory consuming app. Please bring back the functionality!
Nice
Fine
sick of seeing posts that are 2 days old if i want to see most resent I've got to faf around... sort it out FB its not rocket science ffs
I can open the News Feeds.. but I cannot open my messages..Why?What is wrong???
Its good but the dp of ma frnd don't change with their new update
Its good
Very nice update.. kool!!
Blahh
Recent post should be default, whose ridiculous idea was it to show me two week old posts?
3
facebook is very very importen..no Fb no GAME
Far much better than going to internet and loging in
Update didnt fix a thing. Still crashes frequently on samsung tab 3
Good
Wish it had some good sppeeeeed along with messsenger  cnt load meseengr again n again messsenger shud b in fb app
The app works great but there are times it freezes and it won't let me refresh the newsfeed etc. Overall I'm satisfied though don't get it how I have to have separate messaging app
Could do with italics!
Ok ok
lovely app
Great
Back to being a wonky hardly functional app for those of us in rural America with weak signal.
But it is not working. I can't see news feeds also friend request.  Before it was working properly.
I've had to downgrade from the update because it keeps crashing. Fb get your act together. It's been long enough, you should know what you are doing.
Just what was needed, another update.  Now it locks or freezes.  Get it right once, just once is all we ask for.  I would also be nice to have the feed default to most recent or at least give us the option to choose.
Nothing new in this update
Brilliant.
Bartley
Big app but works
Its sooo bad bcz its buffering only and after showing error newsfeed.....I unistall it.....
It could change a little but it is great
Sometimes doesn't show same feed items as desktop
Every second day there is an update. The moment you log in it shows update of some other apps. Y is it linked to updating and notifing of updates of other apps all the time. Also takes too much of the memory with constant updates...  Too boring
facebook
Cannot play videos anymore
Since the latest update the app freezes , or closes itself down. Newsfeed is still all over the place. And to many adds/page sugestions
Its the best app to stay connect with friends.
It could be better, but it could be a hell of a lot worse...  I can see what some friends are doing, at least.  :-/
My facebook s close can't upload photos. I want to facebook on it s can photos upload
Very smelly
Facebook
Facebook
Nothing to say
Oum
Constantly crashes and freezes zuckerberg. Sort it out you cockwomble
Most annoying app. Constantly giving me "notifications" asking if I know some random person which I can't turn off without turning off all facebook notifications.
Track phone system sucks!!!!!
Love
"COPY POST URL" WILL NEVER ARRIVE ON ANDROID;no way to copy text from posts;no chatheads;can't move photos from one album to another; no share as msg; Tried to share a public post to a friends' timeline and got "status update failed".Does not show group admins when managing a group.Inconsistent look of newsfeed vs group feeds when having large fonts. Sharing from shazam "ooops something went wrong"!!!
Constant crash and freeze on my Galaxy S2.  Have to pull the battery most times.  Hate having to manually view recent stories.
I meqn its giid
Great new ideas
It is nice
Good job
Wwwwww
MARRIED HAPPILY

Super

The interface is better, but are missing options to give user greater control, which is essential.
Awesome
Invasion of privacy lol even if i don't post.
Same update after every 15 days
I'd like to see the most recent posts instead I always see day old posts even after I switch from top stories to most recent... Fix this please.
Am not the biggest fan of Facebook but as it comes preinstalled I make use of it to stay in touch with friends and family. It does this job well.
Uglyyyyyy!!!!

Vary very bad
Creasy
I just updated my Facebook today, with the latest update & now it will NOT do anything!!! It wont even open!! So I tried uninstalling & reinstalling the App, and it still does not work!!! So now what do I do!?!?!
I REALLY think that Facebook wants to lose users.Welcome failures!
Facebook
Hy
I cannot use my emails  address
it' s ok
Very nice
I love it
rajan
I can't upload any videos
It keeps crashing. When it feels like it, it kickes you out. Takes ages to load.
Love
Always fail, takes always a while to load. Complete suck.
It's staying one star until 'Most Recent' becomes the default setting. It's called a NEWS Feed, not a Popularity Feed. There needs to be an option to change it instead of going all the way to the right side menu and selecting it. We need to be able to make Most Recent the default setting.
good
for me, FB is the best social media thus far
Not very good. Makes me force close whenever I click on on a picture or try to play a video.
Great! :-)
Sick & tired of constantly having to uninstall just to get newsfeed to work properly.  If only I could rate it as zero stars. #fail
Awesome..App..must try it..
Freezes.. Everytime i hit notifications button takes me to the same post over an over regardless of how many new notifications i have
Lovely
I like it!!!
Ok
App to slow to install
Nice i am like
The Facebook App Consumes to much (MB)
No for the messenger
Every time someone posts a video link I cannot view it with the mobile app. Says error cannot find video.
Please bring back the via android post or via what smartphone the user is using. If you bring it back I'll rate 5 stars. Also it keeps crashing now.
I cant use this because my android version is too old, why? Sad tbh
Would better if you did not have to use that messenger app to text peoole
The first
not working gd.
Loved it realy  ...its amazing and helpfull to connect my friends..
Supar
Time waste
I love fb helps me keep in  touch with everyone i cant otherwise share pics and see theirs :)
Facebook addict <3
Good
I just downloaded Facebook on my new tablet and every time I try to open my Facebook, everything is black. I let it sit for a few minutes but it just stays black. I have un-installed and reinstalled it twice already and it still open up with a black screen. It seems you guys just make the problem worse with each update.
Ok
Facebook is not working at all. I can't open any news or messages.  Please do the needful.
Can i join me :)
Good app. Easy to use.
So so
Slowest
Everytime i go to my news feed, it says everything was posted "just now". Cant even tell when the statuses were even posted!!!!
Lol but other than that the app is okay haha
Its cool nd nice now
Slow & laggy, freezes my mob. Useless app.
I don't want to install the instant messenger and would like to be able to read my messages still, but now I can't read my private messages unless I download that instant messenger thing, that I don't want. Is there a way to by pass that so I can read my messages? Please Help!!!
Why do these companies constantly release updates that stop things from working. App was fine this morning, now it won't load. Now I remember why I stopped using facebook in the first place. And will anyone get back to me on it? Of course not.
Fake aap
Its ok but plz!!make The news feed load it well..im going crazy just reading error loading news feed..
I don't get it. I never had problems sign in before I installed this... I can't believe :(

But...in future I realy dun know...

I like the new look.. But can you explain to me why I have two news feeds? Far left icon and far right?  This thing needs an instructions manual. But.. I'm a bloke so I won't read it.
I cant access my others messages Y?
Ever since I updated the app on  my Samsung Galaxy 4 the app is not working! I get booted or cannot like or post.. App not working!
Stop making updates you make facebook app less reliable thats what you need to work on not add use less stuff.
Ok
Finaly good update,fb is now smooth,no lags and other craps as before.dont change nothing,just keep it in this direction.
Wow
Facebook is like reading the yellow pages, but with more ads. Not to mention the app is garbage. The bank of america one has less ads.
Love it
So nice working good

Amazing
Facebook is the best.
Facebook

WHY YOU, DEVELOPERS, KEEP ON FORCING US, THE USERS, TO INSTALL THE MESSENGER APP. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION, BUT YOU'RE TAKING THAT RIGHT AWAY FROM US!!! SO DISAPPOINTING!!!
Superbbbb
Facebook freeze on me all the time have uninstall it to logoff
I liked it you should download it
Its ok
Just okay
Stop screwing with it and trying to make me download messenger app

There is a problem when I want to mention people in the comments... by write @name ... and this person is not my friend can not be mentioned... fix that and I give it 5 stars
Omg! Why am I constantly getting notifications on my phone? I've turned off everything I can, but they won't stop. Even in the middle of the night. It's driving me crazy. Please let me have control over my notifications getting pushed onto my phone.
I like cos you can surf n browse thru  facebook much faster...
Full connection. WiFi. ..... everything else loads but my cover photo.  And when I use someone else's facebook to look at my profile, you aren't able to see it either. What the hay?!!!
very bad
Face book is really ideal idea book
Lollxx
Every time I install the update it doesn't allow me to open the app, please fix! I also do not like that to read messages people send me that I have to install messenger which I don't want to do
All ways update
update please it wont let me change my cover photo
Love it
Slow
I had a problem with my network when I was acessing facebook,when I fix that problem though, My news feed wont open,I can't check profile picture,It's messed up I also cant access  my profile now pls fix this

Cant add photos on the album. Stuck on choosing the photos when you click thw next arrow it wont load ;(
My Facebook is always forcing me to close it
How can we change our fb profile photo with this app?
Superb
The sync thing that shows up very time I sign in is really annoying. Please try to remove that. Really slow and the design sucks.
Totally fail.not login if login then not log out and not work.fail fail fail fail fail fail fail fail.
I love it. The comments for the first time in the New Year.
...but has unfortunately become a most popular communication method among my friends and family. So, until FB grows a conscientious and a heart, I will have to overdose on ads so they can make more money.  It sucks that they peel their users to get so much more of it. Meh to you, FB.
Bhout achi app hai
Exclusive
Gud one to keep in touch with old friends...!!
Facebook should go back to the way it was not forcing people to use apps they don't want to

Love it
It's good
I love it but i can't delete my wrong comments
Nicg
Love it!!!
Why does it crash everytime!.can't get it to open even with an  optimized ram. Make an update and fast
Can't access; app keeps crashing.
does not open messages without messenger
I. Love Facebook
n l po
Nice app free good show
I hate this update
It full of fun
Musikavanhu
Pls fix the bug, it takes too long to open it !
Every time I launch the app I get a brief flash of a post I want to read. Half a second later, the feed reloads and the post I wanted to see is nowhere to be found.
It would be extremely nice to connect without crashing when I tap on the Facebook app. on my phone. I have been satisfied up until about a week ago when it started crashing on me. Please fix and I will definitely add 3 more stars to my review!
I'm not a fan of the new in-app viewing of articles and games for one simple reason... before this new update I could save web pages on my browser for reading later, and return to FB. Now I can't do that. With this new update I must watch Right Now or lose that article. That isn't an improvement
I DO NOT WANT THE MESSENGER dont force me to install the messenger i hate it
Super
I don't want to download messenger and I want my news feed to always show most recent not top stories
Window get update but Android don't .. I window now we can see all post by every pages but still not in android application ..
Creator
Good
Keeps freezing up my phone galaxy s3. Slows everything down .
Upgraded itself...
Could we maybe integrate Facebook messenger to Facebook?  With both on my phone it gets to be a memory hog.
This new version is crap. Cant access my messages without stupid messenger. Facebook has gone crap.
awesome app
Verry nice.. thanks a lot!
Sonis
It seems that the tablet non-existent tablet interface has gotten worse over the last year.
The owner of this iphone
After the update it just crashes in less than 2 seconds
Nonono
Nice
Seems to work ok. Only just started though.
I swear that every other up date breaks it. I'll have one good update then a bad one. Just like facebook Messenger. I'm getting to the point I don't want to update our even use them anymore
After update, facebook apps always crash on start.
its nice
Stop making me download your extemely intrusive messenger app! Way around it is to uninstall facebook then reinstall it. Then it will let me read messages for about 2 weeks without being invaded by facebook messenger.
I am one of the many with the wakelock problem.
Very good
Media crashes regularly. Pain
No good
Its a gud aap
I am not getting any notifications sent to my phone even though everything is turned on.
I open the app and it says "setting up Facebook" Idk if its my phone or the app, but its annoying. Other than that, when the app finally opens its pretty great
It needs updateed always and takes a long time to load. Freezes up all the time. It also takes up too much memory. It kinda sucks and I hope you guys update it so it stops freezing up my phone. I will rate it five stars when you do so.
Good and fast search for communication from friend to friend.
This is prefect
:)
Md sahil shiekh
Why i just updated it and its hanged on start up page
Freezes up even worse than before since new update. Most recent should be default news feed -galaxy s4
its fast n cool to use
Kamal
good
so nice...!
Awesome
So very helpful
Memory usage is way over 20 mb try more like 60 and even when using most recent post it still shows post hours and even days old,
Android's version of Facebook apk is better than any other apk (WP, Iphone...). A lot of the desktop experience options were added to this apk. Thanks for hearing our screams.
Lolo
Won't start on my phone following update.
Good app but sum time working very slow
Dont need facebook to make friends
Ang lupet
Always closing. Please fix
My fb
Always show "Setting up Facebook" and after that it show "Just a moment" I wait for 10 min not thing happen
Good,
nay khin
App Takes up to much memory on phone
Ronidebnath
I honestly think that they should return the old Facebook version because this one lags too much and it should have in messaging and not have to message using the Messenger
Sandhu saab
I realy like it
Now the android version won't open any links to stories from my feed. I can't stop getting "replies" to one comment I left on a TV show's page even after turning off notifications and trying to block the page. Auto play for videos turned itself back on. App keeps freezing my phone. Uninstalling yet again! Samsung S4
Plz fix the problem. One of one folder.i cant find what i want pic.all pics are there.
Love u
Nice
Verry nice
(1) I'd like to use the app again for private messages. (2) I cannot choose to post to specific people only, which is an old feature in the iOS version. (3) Facebook clearly sees Android as a second class product. Most of their efforts go to iOS.
Excellent
Apparently after the "update" messaging was removed and now to get at them on a phone you need another app. Makes no sense. Also, why in the hell do we need to access webpagesbfrom inside the app? Was opening them in the browser really that bad? That actually worked and didn't freeze when I tried to scroll down.                  All this and it still has the bug where it randomly freezes while I scroll through my newsfeed.
Everytime I use it, got stuck and a msg comes, not responding. It goes on crashing all the time.really u hve made it the worst app after its recent update.
Why is Facebook obliging me to download Facebook messenger by blocking my access to my messages ! It's outrageous, I won't get messenger app, I'll delete and reinstall Facebook app each and every time it happens ! I'm fine with the messaging services the FB app offers.
Keeps crashing since last update (forced!)
Raushan Raj
nice
Not happy because the phone is download and the problem me is full phone
All of a sudden, I can't like, comment, or share. Sure I can read things, but nothing else. Just started yesterday, please fix!

The Fact That We Got To Download The Messenger App To Message People. Leave It How Facebook Started. Messenger App Was Invented To Make It Faster To Reply Not For It To Take Over And Not Be Able To Reply With That Specific App.
Need to make it possible to move photos to any album you want!!
This app is awesomely designed!! But it requires more data.. When I use Wi-Fi, data is not a problem at all.. But when I use mobile data it eats data very much.. Please do whatever..
Thakur
All love it
Ok
Constantly freezes up, things are going missing, inability to access various areas, fix whatever you did already. Beyond irritated by Facebook's policies and the app lately.
Nice

It's amazing facebook...
Freezes with new update when opening links in fb app instead of browser
superrr
So so so good
ITSSSSSSS Suckssss !!
Thanks Great Britain and America United States rajasthan to gujrat
This is rediculous! I can't log in on the app only on the internet! This needs to be fixed. For such a big company you suck at doing your job!
I love fb cause u can do lots of things
I hate how they make u download a separate app for messages so stupid , made me stop using the app
Very good
This app is always having crackfits for unknown reasons and won't allow me access to what I actually want to see. Pics and videos do not show up right, and if you want to upload a video as part of your status it's not even an option even after telling to let you select the file you want it simply won't allow access to anything but a photo file. Now my phone has been doing weird stuff unrelated to fb and I did a factory reset only to find this phone comes with this ridiculous app that doesn't ever work! !!!
Face book is very poor
Exallant
I cant even get into fb now ugggh fix this soon its so annoying
Really worth the download no faults at all no lag no error screens
Hope kng sana
Knpa fb ni ada masalah ada ganguan lha
nice to have
Always hang
That fb messenger is so suck!!
Really Slow refresh with newest update
It wont let me login
Good
Taking too much memory space
Very good

Gud  one
This app for some reason won't let me alter who can and can't see my statuses, so I can't block people from certain statuses, whereas my old apple device used to let me. And I would also like to be able to access my 'most recent' newsfeed easier, the current way is very annoying, I don't like it at all. Just a few minor fixes to make this app perfect!
Can't download please solve the problem
Excellent
exellen
great but sometines it force closes please fix!!!
Its a best social networking site to get together with friends
My account not working
I am forced to install a facebook messenger?!
I open fb its getting stucked and even full mobile is getting stucked. My sister has deleted this app from her mbl then MBL is working in good condition
Please make it so it doesn't use so much battery.
everyone like it
good
Samsung Droid User. FB app keeps closing on my frequently. I have un/installed and updated virus protection.  Uninstalling FB app.
Won't load photos or videos anymore.
It won't let me in......or is it my retarded 3g phone??
Number one app for lying cheating cyber stalking and keeping stupid people together so they can breed a race of super stupid people thank you Facebook.  Ohh and I also like the recipes for meth and plastic explosives my friends post.

Super
It sucks you need messenger cause fb app doesnt have the messenger in itself. Takes up my space and data and stuff.
Sucks
I was worried about putting Facebook on my new Galaxy S5, that it would take over my entire phone and OS (Android, not Microsoft Mobile) but shockingly, it hasn't so far. It's a little glitchy with the messenger component but I'm sure that will be fixed in a future update.
The "news feed" still sucks and the messanger app will never be on my phone. Money hungry control freaks..
New Version
Michelle Franklin 91@gmail. Com
Trying to use the app and i can scroll down to a point than it freezes and boots me off. Its been doing this since i updated it. Fix pleaseee
It sucks cant message without messenger i cant fitbothof them on my phone
Like it
Loveit
Cool
Too much crap
haha cute ko pala hihi
SO FRUSTRATED, I have been noticing that random posts with or without pictures (nothing bad AT ALL, like moving my son into college...& things like that) are removed from my timeline after not even a month. Isn't that the whole point of Facebook, is to document, state, and or share things that have meaning to you?  NOPE, GO TO SHOW SOMEONE, LOOK FOR IT AND BOOM IT'S GONE!  and gives your location on a whim.  Either it does or doesn't but let the user decide that....
Cool
Thank you.
Awesome
Could not open fb after this update
Simple not good
Keeps freezing samsung g4
Why so many frequent updates? Its annoying and you still dont fix the issues!

How come this app is able to take pictures with my phone record me at any time read my messages oh and send messages without my permission have access to basically everything on my phone isnt that a violation of privacy not happy I think its uncalled for and dont know how its justified
I  love it
Good apps
I have had problems with the same time as well as the first time in history of our business owners of your own site is global economy and the United with

facebook
This machine can topple a govt

Kk
I actually want to give you a ZERO rating. Your trying to do things you shouldn't have access to. My contacts text and personal photos also other accounts. That is none of your business. I deleted your messenger app and refuse to download it again.
Great
Absolutely shameful #nuffsaid #opinionsvary #hadtobesaid. Can't use it on my phone. Freezes every time I use it so app is deleted
Crazy
Im bother is a retard
Jepoy.
The app for some reason will just kick out! It says it had a error loading the news feeds! You would think that the people creating this website/app would think and be more concerned on how to please the people that are making them rich rather than creating more permissions! It would be great to be able to reconnect with people you haven't seen in years and not have to worry about headaches!
very well good team work..
still freezes up my phone fix it or i will never download it again on my phone this is the last time
Fb
Cool.....

I like this app
Very good app
What the heck.....all I get is error everytime I post, comment or like something! I logged off and now it says error everytime I try to log in!.. not happy at all! Fix it! I want it to back!!!
Sexy

Awesome
Should be the default setting, I don't care what Facebook thinks it's most important to me, I want my info chronologically.
Why do you need to access my app/device history? My call log? My camera and microphone without my permission? It's invasion of privacy! Want to be spied on then this app is for you!
It is a very nice Facebook
This app wants all your personal and private info and the ability to do with it what Facebook pleases.
It freezes and crashes constantly. I also wish when I shared pics it wouldn't upload them but just share on my wall/feed.
Esta mucho mas practico
Smooth
Great app
I hate how I have to use messenger to read messages and I cant view my others folder unless I go online
Can't attach pictures to anything to save my life. Finding settings for just about anything is a nightmare. Status updates and things I've attempted to share sometimes just don't show up. Still not happy about your use of our data
It randomly freezes. And it's never the most recent stories. This sucks please update.
Me
Keeps kicking me out and "rebooting" everytime I get on. AWFUL. Fix it!
ilove8
Cherie
Its download.
whnever i logout the app close automaticaly....
Seriously crashes like every 10secs and you get the same status updates from the same people instead of other friends you have. Not cool
I've a note 2. Since last upgrade it's been freezing and shutting down (!?)
When i get on facebook sometimes it can go slow but most of the time its gos fast ashley was here
Its so slow to download a Facebook in my tablet,why and what happen,error 24..!! Fix please..... now?thanks...
Awesome
Very nice
Keeps taking my running videos down

The app rarely works correctly. Incredibly disappointing coming from a multibillion dollar international company
Are you kidding me, again I can't message anymore screw facebook rather not use it then download your stupid facebook messenger app
All u sed app
This new update stinks.  The stupid thing always a stop working when in use
Shrivastavs

Very bad app no work perfectly ......I hate this app....

Like it ...
Fh
I cant find my videos and that sucks. Also o cant see recent updates on my newsfeed please changeeeeee
Keeps crashing on my Tab 3 since the last update was installed.
I don't like the new update.  I used to open links in my browser (android tablet), and read them when I had time. Now links open up in the app and I'm not able to do that! Please make an option for those who prefer links to open in the browser -- UPDATE: ok just found out there IS an option, I must have missed it.
Good
Bapu kale
Hi  My name is of no importance but what is, is that if you lost contact with someone you love join the millions of  people around the world here on facebook  because one just might be the one your searching for.....I foud my love ones here maybe you can too or make a friend or two......sign..a friend...aka...Mike
Nice
Crashes every time I try to open it! Please fix it
Facebook is making my phone going TOO SLOW!! And also nobody wants the in-app Facebook messenger :/ fix it or update it back to the old version without having to install another f*cking app for be able to see messages...
for an older virsion
The internet connection is fast but this updated app is so slow and then the moment you are going to login the app will crash. Please fix this guys. Old version is easier and faster than this.
I think it's not enough
My hate
Nice cool
Its always not responding and sumtimes does not even load at all.You have to wait for it for a long time jst for it to load
Family
It freezes my phone up
Top ah top

rajan
Syok2 je...
Very nice app......
Cannot switch to recent feed. Also cannot customize privacy setting of posts. Yes there's a "customized" option, but won't let u see or choose who's in it
Nice app
I love this app so much <:> That is a smier :):) of that
Why when I see "new" news feeds there are already 20 people that have commented? Why isn't stuff real time across the board. Nobody likes to be the last to know.

Facebook is intriguing because when I'm waiting on a phone call I gets bored of waiting. So I log on to this social media website begin looking around at all of my friends postings of their statutes, pictures, and videos. To be honest some of the things they post about be quite interesting. I have fun on this site while I waste a little time waiting.
The newsfeed order is stupid and whenever I unsubscribe or turn off notifications I still get an alert every time that post is commented on. There are way too many permissions that are needed to download this app. The only plus is that uploading pics is easier than doing it through the browser. The fact that I can't see my messages without using the browser or downloading messenger is ridiculous. ** And it's impossible to turn off the auto update feature. That's a joke.

I hate the new app it never allows me to see ALL my post on my timeline I don't like to be limited to what I can see on my page I HATE IT UGGHHH. IM ANGRY
Awsome
Interestng
Keeps freezing
Another bad update! New update won't even open fb on my phone. First no more messaging and new this grrr..
Marlon
Mast
Constantly crashes and reverts back to main screen, totally unstable....need fix or people are going to go elsewhere!
I can't upload video!
takes up so much memory. Its stored automatically to my sd card which is great but it still uses up A LOT of phone memory too. I EVEN FIND THAT MY PHONE DECLINES NEW INCOMING TEXTS Bcuz OF THE "LOW INTERNAL MEMORY". I find myself deleting FB until I really need to use it. Not ideal at all. If it wasn't for that issue I'd give 5 Stars.
Slows down my phone. Pictures take ages to get downloaded. Messed up news feed.
don't work
Love
helpfull
Why would you remove the messenger?
Good app
Continuous force close with this application
I have just no word to say and no thing to amaze over it...
Communicate with my love one..
Nice app it nevered let me down.
Terrible update!! Constantly freezing and showing unable to refresh feed.
Not working properly for samsung star
It is good in all but take a long time to load
Keeps crashing! Wont let me log in!!!
I like it except I been getting a lot of stalkers
Supra hits app's
Thanks
I'm surprised that this app isn't asking to know when I wipe my as*, since it wants permission for just about everything else!!!  And why does it need all these permissions?  GEESH, even my bank doesn't need 20% of all the permissions this app wants, and my bank is my link to all my $$$ accts!!!  Get real Facebook app, you shouldn't need HALF these permissions.  PERIOD!!!!!
Could not be download

Keep downloading thinking devs have improved it. Still slows my tablet to a craw. So once again I will uninstall.
After the update photos and videos don't load. Why do you guys keep spoiling the app?
Since I updated it, I can't watch videos on facebook . Says "sorry, a unexpected error has occurred while trying to play this video." All videos!!!!
Kot
It gets frozzing
Ur fb browser very bad so eske size ko chota karo 63 mb its big siz and not good work
Keeps saying "Setting up Facebook" & "Just a Moment" uses up all remaining disc space and then will not open.
I cant post status, post picture n check in via facebook....
Very nice
Get a new update and fix some buuuuuuugs.
Social media.
Yellow ranger to blue ranger
Books need to take it off !!!
Why the hell this app uses too much ram? Its too big... 100mb on ram is too much.. While other apps just use 10-50 mb ram
love it
Ahe
Keeps crashing
I want to lock in most recent feed as I do on my desktop. I am thoroughly unconcerned and disinterested in what an algorithm thinks is needing to be on top the listing..
Asia bibi
Please minimise the memory of Facebook! It's too large! Thanks.
Any way I can give a negative star rating?!?!?  How could they have made this worse?!?!  Recent update now only consistently freezes and will not update.   Also instead of having top stories be the primary, how about allowing us to choose most recent feeds as the constant opening.   FB mobile app is horrendous.
J
Facebook is interesting because when I'm waiting on a phone call I gets bored of waiting. So I log on to this social media website begin looking around at all of my friends postings and some of the things they post about be quite interesting. I have fun on this site while I waste a little time waiting.
This is rediculous! I can't long in on the app only on the internet! This needs to be fixed. For such a big company you suck at doing your job!
Since last update will not load on WiFi. I have tested my WiFi to see if its the router but it works fine on ever other app but Facebook.  I have to turn WiFi off for it to load
Paula Internpastor.
Good
Work good but not great
Excellent.
Facebook
Good
Freezes, does not include all updates in my feed, shows me updates hours later, is not current and I miss info. Selective in what content I see ??????
My rating
MST but few slow
Awesome
Why update if you don't add any new features for everyone? The app would be perfect if it sorted comments in the new format, let you reply from mobile, and edit and delete comments and posts. It lets me delete sometimes, but rarely. If those features were added, 5 stars. EDIT: Even after an update, the comments STILL Don't sort right.
I like facebook
I don't like the new built in link viewer/browser. I want my links to open in Chrome/Firefox not Facebook. Also stop tracking everything I click.
I hate that it forces you to download the messager app just to see your messages! The app takes up half the space on my phone as it is, with the messager, it leaves me no room on my phone for anything else! This should be an option not mandatory!
I can't see pictures or videos.  App is really slow.
I like it
getting worse
best app ever
But it make so hang our mobile. Pls try to update
Nice i like it
Loving it
Can't use it more two second before it crashes please fix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Facebook
Please
Nice
I don't want to have to install the messenger just to direct message someone. Don't like the notification, the bubble face. ....just keep it in fb.....what's wrong with that, unless u want more of our info.... think we give enough already
It is faster n efficent
I love facebook
FABULOUS
But really?? I dont want to know whos in a realtionship? That has nothing to do with me!!!
Nice I like it
Wow so fast
It is good but is enough room for improvement.
good
After the last update a little while ago, it seemed pretty great. Now it's like it regressed back to an older version THAT SUCKS!
Nice

Hehe
Jai hind
Videos keep freezing when play
Great
I don't know what's going with these updates. I can say this the last update I received has slowed down Facebook on Galaxy S5 4GLTE . This starting to becoming a problem!! Please fix now
Dan "ANGRY BIRD"Fuller
Great
Latest update crashes all the time Tab 3
Will not let me log out.Keeps freezes.Say session expaired please log in again.Than keeps repeating when I try to log out.A real pain in the butt.
Super life is day enjoy
Commenting is annoying and when I press "like" on a status in my newsfeed, it unlikes it immediately after.
It is awesome app I just love it
To know other relatives and friends....
I like it
Can't upload video.. :-(
Hi
Verry good Applikation instead of going to google or other Internet providers just click the link

Face book
Sometimes it takes high CPU usage of my sony z1
The app updated and now won't download or it will saying downloading and closes after 2 seconds of being open
Coool but take lot of space ferry
I love it
Except, all the news feed.
Fine
I think its a good app
Awesome
For what
Good
Frends
Oh yeh
After the last update, it quits abruptly (without allowing me to report it) making it absolutely unusable on the galaxy tab 3. Please fix.
Salavi
Love it
Facebook
Yar wo old facebook. Thik ta.
Lots of fatal crashes
this is how I had f my family
Update the app so we can upload  HD videos
It should be secure also I should be a better way to order things off of Google Play
Sometimes it can log me in and sometimes it can't. It can be slow when loading and it's not my internet. Right now it won't log me out completely so when I try to log in again it jumps to the" tap to reload news feed" screen or shows up a blank screen.
Facebook
Update it but Facebook starts to shut off by itself
After update can't open...very poor...
Crash crash and then it crashes again
Super
